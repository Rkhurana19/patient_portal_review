What do you expect from an app that is named after Anthem CTO's dog. Who uses conventions like these in apps? It won't let me login. I spent over an hour with a rep on the phone trying different things to login. I still cannot login. I tried fetching my ID card on anthem's website and while it lets me login, it won't display my ID card and errors out. I'm anticipating a response asking me to email these folks for a resolution. No, I will not do that. I already spent an hour with a rep on the phone. The onus is on anthem to build an app that is supposed to provide basic functions like showing you your ID card. I cannot wait for this good for nothing middle man industry to perish. EDIT: Looks like the issues are a result of the ever growing complications within the medical industry. I have recently learned that there's a middleman negotiating claims between my employer and anthem. A middleman to the middleman if you can say that. This unfortunate complexity led to me having to access my insurance information from the third party middleman's website, which is yet another example of how incompetent the system is. Perhaps Anthem could notify or email upon login that you should be consulting with HR or you might fall under the bracket of a third party claims provider. Instead, they just put you in an ""expired"" group with no access to ID cards or app login.",1,42,4.15.1,2022-02-15 15:51:29,"Hello S R, we're sorry you had this kind of experience and can understand why that would be frustrating.

Every time I was owed money from approved claims it took three months to get my checks from them with multiple times I had to get checks reissued because they blamed the US mail. I don't see how US mail supposedly lost them multiple times. I was lied to several times!!
