mjgshshejn,5,Really helpful,False,2021-11-11 22:39:08,"As someone who frequently uses the VA website for disability claims and healthcare, this is a huge timesaver. I read in another review that there might soon be notifications of medical appointment changes.  This would be huge since I‚Äôm usually not told when an appointment changes or gets cancelled.  The only improvement I would like to see is an ability to refresh the status of a disability claim.  For instance it is 4:30 in the afternoon now but it is showing my most recent status from when I checked it at 10pm yesterday.  It seems you can only check it once per 24 hours with the app.  This is fine most of the time but when they are getting close to publishing a final decision, I‚Äôd like to refresh more often. As it stands, this is now pushing me back to the website daily.",,,
Phillip M. Burroughs,5,My Sanctuary,False,2022-03-20 13:53:35,"I cannot express how much the Veterans Administration in Richmond Virginia has turned my life around making me the man who I am today. I love being a Marine and the integrity it is taught me to be accountable and respectful to others. Problem is, it was a journey that text my soul and my body. The Doctors, Nurses, Specialist, Assistants (not to mention all the supporting roles that interact with we Veterans) at the Veterans Hospital in Richmond have been instrumentally and spiritually and helping me grow and rebuild my body.
Whereas I‚Äôve heard many veterans have challenges that have resulted in given opportunities for their individual growth; of the almost 25 years I‚Äôve been going to the sanctuary I‚Äôve had nothing but outstanding treatment.
This new app has been another tool that has giving me the opportunity to submit this declaration, that I want the whole hospital to know, this is one Veteran that absolutely loves everybody who has done nothing but give and helping us (& me) in rebuilding our lives. From the deepest parts of my body, thank you for everything you have done for me and mine. God bless you all.

BMWs1000rr-Rider,3,Useful but lacking,False,2022-04-26 06:16:58,"The app is very helpful in being able to quickly look at your claim status and any upcoming appointments. However, it is severely lacking in showing some of the same important information that is available on the website, such as any documents being requested from you, to be submitted by a deadline. Many Vets may not check the website on a regular basis, if they are solely using the app to check their claim status. Also, with the horrendous pace of snail mail notifications from the VA, having that info available within the app, becomes doubly important to be able see it in a timely manner. Also, it would be of great help if there were notifications, or if a badge icon would appear, to show that there is an update/change to a claim in progress, instead of the incessant checking most vets will do in the app, or web page on a daily basis.",,,

thedcoy,1,Not for IPhones,False,2022-06-02 19:05:36,"Both apps for VA Health and Refills are useless on iPhones. First, after enduring all the redirects you come to the page where you sign in. Once you sign in, you often get an error saying no internet connection. Which is untrue as you test your signal and it‚Äôs strong. I went with the apps because the browser website failed to work 90% of the time. I sure hope they fix these issues soon, as I‚Äôd like to check my appointments, message my doctor, and refill my medications. As of today, I have to deal with long waits on the phone as well as call backs.

jclovs,5,Everything I‚Äôve ever wanted from a VA App/website.,False,2022-04-03 03:03:29,"All I can say is that this app is smooth, fast, and just works brilliantly. Unlike all the other websites and online tools from the VA this things works exactly like I would like with zero issues that I have encountered. Has all the features of va.gov and myhealthyvet that I use or have tried to use. It‚Äôs been a long time coming but you all have finally cracked the code. This app is awesome. Thanks!",,,
Gforce75,5,Impressed,False,2022-03-15 03:48:38,"I'm still on active duty going through the BDD program. I'm super impressed by this app. As a programmer myself, the UI is clean and straightforward. Some complaints are valid, but the safari issue may be the users.phone configurations and has nothing to do with this app. People can change their default browser but have no problems. I would recommend that if the app and browser have issues, give the users a reason for the faults. If the app can detect problems internally, that would help, but it's mainly on the user side. Anyways, keep improving this app! You make the lives of many far easier. The website is too chonky, as my daughter would say.",,,

Myimzadi,5,Amazing app,False,2022-01-06 00:55:03,"What a time saver, if I could give 6 stars I would.

My only complaint is the benefits shown on app have one discrepancy from the va site when I click review letter. One says P&T while the other says IU. 

I think this falls more on the ppl entering info vice the app team so I definitely give this max stars plus 1.  

Also if you haven‚Äôt signed up for Id.me yet I highly recommend, much smoother process",,,

Crab painter,1,Isolated case? Perhaps,False,2022-01-10 20:20:38,"Scenario: pluck out my trusty iPhone. Tap the VA app and TRY to check messages. 
Well sometimes this works. 
Sometimes it tells me I need to upgrade to premium. 
Which leads me to wonder why are there two versions of this app anyway???
But whatever. 
I did the ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù. And in fact on the VA website next to my name is an honorary premium member moniker. 
And yet the upgrade message randomly pops up on the app. 

So for me it‚Äôs one star until things work as advertised. 

Side note. 
Why are there several different apps trying to perform the same basic function? 
I‚Äôve got so many goofy hoops to jump through I‚Äôm beginning to thing the VA is trying to dodge their responsibility. 
MyHealthyVet is an absolute tin can of computer code that North Korea must‚Äôve come up with just to get even. 
Then there‚Äôs HumanaMilitary‚Ä¶. Is that still working? 
Why can‚Äôt the VA authenticate us without a third party? 
I haven‚Äôt had access to classified material in a long time but this is ridiculous.",,,
