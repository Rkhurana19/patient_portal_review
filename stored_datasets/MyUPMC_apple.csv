False,You are in Control of Your Own Health Results!,MieneKatzen,All my friends tell me how they hate using these ‚Äúonline portal accounts‚Äù because they believe that they are difficult to use. I used to feel that way too! But the UPMC portal was easy to setup and easy to use. It really does make reordering prescriptions easier and lab and test results are there usually in one day or less!! You can‚Äôt beat that! How awesome to not have to sit and worry about a blood test result or a scan until you can get another appointment to see your doctor for your result. There‚Äôs a brief review of your results right there at your fingertips! You have the control of your results! And you can message your doctor any questions that you may have. I especially like that I don‚Äôt have to call the office and take up the nurses time asking them questions that I can now directly message to my doctor. And I‚Äôm sure they appreciate it too!,5,2020-07-11 04:10:55,We‚Äôre so glad you‚Äôre enjoying MyUPMC and appreciate your positive review!

False,Still needs work,Ellisaurus,"I like that I can see all of my test results in the app - that is a nice feature. The scheduling feature is ok, but about half the time I still need to call UPMC for assistance.

The appointment scheduler is 50/50. I find myself still having to call places to make appointments fairly often. But I do like that I can see when my next appointments is, with whom, and where it is located. That is very helpful on the day of the appointment.

However billing (and billing across UPMC in general) is ridiculous and needs work. If I select ‚Äúdetails‚Äù to find out why I owe a certain amount, I should see the reason for the amount. Not the number merely repeated again without stating which service this fee is for. If I go to statements to see details, it once again just restates the fee but not the reason for the fee/service provided. I‚Äôve had a lot of medical appointments recently and I‚Äôm finding it very hard to keep track of what I paid for which appointment when I am given no information. Also, some services like PT can‚Äôt be paid for in the app or on UPMC‚Äôs main website in the normal billing place?! Their bills state you can pay online, but I have to spend 30 minutes trying to find that specific bill and payment method. If the app had provided details of what I was paying for, I might not have received threats of sending me to collections in the mail from PT‚Äôs billing dept.",3,2021-01-08 13:33:20,"Hi, thanks for letting us know about the problem you're having with billing in the MyUPMC app. We are sorry that you've had a frustrating experience.

False,Quick App for GREAT information!,daynee73,"It took a bit to open and get it installed etc.. However, the wonderful UPMC call person was as patient as a mother teaching her child... ok, I am not very tech savvy... 
We were on the phone over an hour!! Yet they never were anything but polite and helpful. 
Once installed, I have yet to have a problem using it for whatever I wanted to see or do. Do I still call offices to make appointments, or check in to my appointment on the office itself? Yes, but the days of calling to ask when and what time my appointment is ( because I can‚Äôt find it in my iPhone) are over. Plus, you can see test results instead of waiting, calling, and holding for a nurse .",5,2021-01-26 14:27:32,Hi! We‚Äôre so glad you‚Äôre enjoying MyUPMC and appreciate your positive review!

True,"Great app, but questionable privacy features",J.Lev,"The app is fine, but after looking at the App Privacy Report in iOS 15.2, I‚Äôm curious why the MyUPMC app has been using data from the microphone twice in the past couple days even though I haven‚Äôt had any virtual visits with a doctor in nearly a year. After talking with UPMC support, they‚Äôre unable to provide an explanation why their app continues to use the microphone and have not provided a resolution since I last emailed them in February of 2022. The developer response here is that it‚Äôs used for virtual visits (even though I haven‚Äôt had any recently and the app continues to regularly access the microphone) and despite them asking me to reach out to support, their support agents have not emailed back. 

Check for yourself! Go to the App Privacy Report under Settings > Privacy > App Privacy Support > Data & Sensor Access to see if MyUPMC is also unexpectedly accessing the microphone on your phone.",3,2022-04-19 11:02:46,"Hello, thank you for leaving your feedback.

False,It works most of the time for most things,A Long 1515,"I don‚Äôt like that I can‚Äôt sort my test results by date or have the same functionality as the website. I can‚Äôt show the results on the graphs or compare previous results. Sometimes past appointments are not able to be viewed by some error or programming fault. They video visits usually work. It has a lot of room for improvement. The website is better for most things.

False,Better on iPhone than iPad,rlbyer,"I really like this App and use it a lot.  But it does not work as well on my iPad.  I have an iPad Pro that I use with the smart cover & keyboard.  That requires that the iPad be in Landscape mode.  However, the MyUPMC App stays in portrait mode and will not switch to landscape when I rotate the screen.  That makes it difficult for me to type (messages, appointment requests, entering health tracking information, filling out pre-visit questionaires, etc) while using the app on my iPad.

False,Making appointment-unable to pick provider from a practice,improvement requsest1,I have been going to the same fabulous practice for 40 years for routine gynecological exams.  The practice is made up of several Drs/PA‚Äôs/CNP‚Äôs. There are 3 individuals that have seen most often in the last 10 years and naturally I want to use the app to look at availability in the practice schedule to see if one of them is available. But the app does not allow this. It will only check availability of the last doctor I saw. It is annoying. I should be able to select from several providers within a practice and see who has openings available - not only the last doctor I saw.,3,2019-09-13 21:40:57,"Hi, thanks for letting us know about the frustrating experience you've been having trying to schedule an appointment.

False,No big changes - ho hum,maryann117,"The new app doesn‚Äôt appear to really offer anything more than the other app (myChart) offered, just a different look.

I was hoping for an improvement, but it still lacks the ability to message all my UPMC doctors -only select ones that opt in are available.  The ability to see doctors‚Äô notes is attractive, but only if they enter info - out of 5 doctors, and 2 recent hospital visits only 2 entered any information at all, and that was limited to vitals and current diagnoses. When I click on schedule an appointment, I get a phone number to call - surely UPMC can do better that than.

False,Fair but not as good as FMH app,Uripidez,"Having switched from Excela (using the  Follow My Health FMH app )back to UPMC, I have to say this app has some design issues.   1. You cannot print your medical records for your files. Nor can you email or fax them to yourself. Or MDs outside the UPMC system. FMH allows you to fax or email all information. 2. There is no way to update address or pharmacy information. Both were 5 yr old data, and every time I go to an MD I have to tell them to change it but they never do.  This results in items sent to wrong address and wrong pharmacy.",3,2020-07-25 13:05:43,"Hi -- Thank you for leaving a review! We are constantly looking for improvements.
