False,"This is a great health related medical app that’s extremely easy to use and a much better option than a box of papers you file away. It’s convenient and you’ll find that your medical information is simple a tap away, whenever you need it, anytime, anywhere.  It helps you to stay on top of all your medical care and the costs. I appreciate the ability to be able to keep an eye on my share of cost, health related billing, and deductibles. 

I only have one request in that it is nice that I am able to share your medical ID card as a pdf, but it would be much better if you allowed the medical ID card to be downloaded into my Apple Wallet along with my other cards. I have my prescription related card, along with my roadside assistance and groceries store cards, the time is now to allow the medical ID card to be utilized with the same convenience. 

Nevertheless, the am ranking this app 4.5 out of 5 stars. Great work!!",Great Health Related App,2021-10-07 22:13:06,5,Mr. Vikk,,,

False,Love that I can see my claims and Rx from the past. But when you need to add notes to your prescriptions there’s a glitch where the keyboard is in the way of the save button and there’s no way of pulling the keyboard down out the way. And they removed the ability to search for a specific doctor by name to see if they are in your network. I had to search a LONG list of several hundred drs and they are listed in no particular order. Just random so you can’t even scroll alphabetically. I swear I seen a dr was in network before contacting her to set up a surgery. But then when I contacted customer service to check on the pre-authorization and get an estimated out of pocket cost I was told she wasn’t in my network and they couldn’t give me an estimate. I went to try and find her in the search again but got tired of scrolling through hundreds of drs and without the ability to search by name it would have taken hours. Now I have learned if I find a dr in the list to take a screenshot of the list and their info. And since they changed things around it was hard to find the section that gives you an estimate out of pocket cost for procedures or for anything.,Great app till you actually need to do or look up something Specific,2021-08-08 05:11:29,2,Lunalyn82,,,
False,"Searching for a healthcare provider using this app is a nightmare. Good luck searching for a specific provider.  Is it under doctors, Specialists, facilities? Who knows! And good luck to you trying to figure it out. Not as simple as just entering a search term and seeing what results match your inquiry like a normal search engine with other insurance companies. 
To top it off, once you find a list of potential providers, make sure you go through them quickly before the app decides to log you out and you have to sign in and start over halfway through your review. 
But, that also depends if the app decides to let you log in at all. Depending on its mood it may log you in or it may tell you that your record wasn’t found, despite using FaceID linked to the same password that’s always worked for you. 
But worst of all, I was able to save a list of all my health providers for easy reference which you’d think is great. Well, that is until the app decided to one day delete all my saved providers so that I had to look for them all over again using their terrible search engine and save them again. Who knows how long they’ll last in my Saved bucket this time. 
I hate this app so much I have basically just resigned myself to using the desktop version.",Terrible glitchy app,2021-01-31 23:17:57,1,DKKeyes,,,
False,"The app allows you to view claims your providers have submitted to the insurer. Some of the claims are eye opening and will surprise you - such as how many claims a single visit might entail. You have the opportunity to mark-off which ones have been paid to assist the insurer to track whether your deductible has been reached. The app also allows you to quickly check which providers are in-network. Prescriptions on OptumRx are managed on a separate app. You can also save the contacts of your regular doctors for easy reference. It will also prompt you to look after your health by getting your blood pressure taken, getting a lipid panel or getting a flu shot. However, you do not put anything personal into the app. It does not collect your health data, so that’s good from a privacy perspective, but if that’s what you’re looking for, you’ll need another app.","Convenient, easy-to-use and useful",2020-09-23 03:50:34,5,Tzups,,,
False,"I will say that I have been very impressed this app. I have had BCBC and Cigna’s apps, and by far UHC has been the most functional and user friendly for me! 

I have only been using it since September 2019 when my benefits switched. All I can say is I never missed a beat and have not had to call UHC for anything to date! For me this alone has me smiling!

I give it 5 stars, but I am great at updating my reviews if and when my experience or thoughts change! Keep it operating properly and don’t try to improve or change it if it’s not broken. Too many companies do this and someone needs to say enough at times!

False,"I love that all my information is at my fingertips including my HSA balance. Very easy to add your doctors that are in network. However I find it annoying that I could not add an out of network physician as my GP. My GP is a PAC, I honestly have never even met the doctor listed on my scripts (who happens to be in-network). I think a seamless integration with MyChart and GoodRX should be something the developers should look into for a one stop shop with appointment scheduling, test results, and medication cost options. As it is now, the user interface is clean and easy to navigate without more than a couple of minutes poking around when you first use it. If you a falling apart like me and have frequent office visits and multiple doctors, it’s a handy app to keep your insurance information and claims in order.",Very convenient,2020-10-23 20:16:45,4,Crystalreg,,,
False,"This app is very useful and I find myself using it frequently.  It is well-designed and relatively intuitive; for starters it is Faced ID-enabled so I don’t have to go looking for my userid and password every time.  It was also smart enough to look up both my current policy and one from a previous job so I can check my full history.  All of my recent claims are here and there are quick links to contact the nurse line, find a nearby provider, or talk directly to UHC.

It would get five stars except for two things: there’s no way to initiate a claim from the app (you have to use the full desktop site) and there seems to be no way to integrate with any medical records (for example, it keeps suggesting that I get my flu shot, even though I got it during a covered visit).

I am being charged as a home infusion, when I have NEVER, EVER had a home infusion my whole life. I have always gotten my infusions at an infusion center. I have also had my IVIG delivered to my house, instead of the infusion center, and they had to return to pick it up. I just received another notification today, saying another IVIG  delivery will be arriving tomorrow. It’s never ending. I have been told over and over and over that it will be red flagged, and I won’t have to worry about it anymore. I have even spoken to my Patient Navigator.

False,"I wanted to say how helpful the UHC rep. Natalie from Columbus, Ohio was last Friday, April 15th. She stayed on the phone with me for over an hour assisting with talking to my current ENT Dr.’s office that was going to do my ear surgery, trying to convince them to pick up UHC/AARP insurance. She was trying to save me money! Researching Network doctors and finding one for me. She connected me with the rep. At the Essentials Account to order diabetic testing supplies, staying on the line until the order was completed. She explained in detail to me what the Essentials account was. I believe she went above and beyond any reps in other insurances normally do!

False,"Why is my previous review deleted Apple??
Same complaint about UHC as before… stopping all promotional emails is not possible. The “opt out” button is non working or fake. It doesn’t do any good to block emails (or unsubscribe) within the Gmail app because UHC periodically uses different addresses to send from… just like scam callers constantly change their phone #.
I don’t believe I want to do business with UHC anymore since this is a representation of how they do all of their business. I’m going to shop around next enrollment time. I’m also going to pass this onto all the FB sites and pages (including a 1400 friend list to pass on) concerning the relentless pursuit of customers when they choose not to be solicited.

I didn’t need it for a while until today; when I tried to log in to resolve an insurance mixup, I was denied entry. After spending some time checking my email and password, I came to the App Store to see if I could get some info here. That’s when I learned that some time during the interim the UHC app was no longer usable by AARP Medicare Advantage/UHC customers. I will be deleting this app - why should I keep something I can’t use? - and I understand UHC has the right to simplify things on their end, but it would have been nice to have received some warning of the change BEFORE I had to use it.

Then he said he’d get someone who knew this app “really well”. Isn’t that why I was connected to him in the first place? Should I ask for the janitor next?

False,"This is a great app. It makes things so much easier. You can access your is card. The app provides you your recent EOB’s as well as your deductible amount and how much money has been applied toward it based on your medical visits.

The best thing about this app is you can search for a specific procedure. This allows you to view the doctors in the area you live or nearby. You see the doctors name as well as reviews. It will show you what the doctor charges and gives a detailed breakdown of what you will pay out of pocket with explanations. You can use this to “shop” different doctors for a lower cost.

False,"I’ve used this app for several years and although the new version of it for 2022 has generally been an improvement, one feature I really employed is now missing. I use this app to participate UHC’s Renew Rewards step program. With the app linked to my iPhone’s health data my steps are recorded. However, in previous years my accumulative step total for the entire year was always available on my UHC account. Now, though, once I had earned my reward for the month all following steps for the month were not available. When I contacted UHC I was told that my tracker was turned off and I needed to sync it. However, there was no way to do this because Step Reward no longer showed as an available activity on my account, I assume because I had already earned it for the month. Further, my tracker was not turned off anyway. It will be interesting to see happens when next month rolls around. Having the ability see see how many steps I have walked throughout the year was a real motivator. My husband and I had quite a competition and made an effort working to pass the three million step mark for the year—not too shabby for a 73-year-old and a 75-year-old. But now that steps no longer register on this app once we’ve earned the reward for the month it’s not nearly as much of an incentive to keep active, which obviously is the whole point of the program. Although my iPhone records my daily steps and provides lots of other related step information, it does not provide an accumulative step total for the year, which is one reason it was such a great feature on the previous UHC app. PLEASE add this feature back into your app so that I can revise my rating to five stars!",Accumulative Step Total Now Missing,2022-01-15 08:13:01,1,CTinOC,,,

False,"I have found this app extremely useful in keeping track of all my claims; all 75 as a result of a hospitalization two years prior. 

Anyway, it’s appreciated that there is an opinion to narrow down searches based on criteria such as date of service, amounts owed, and alphabetical order, etc.
I like that individual claims to be marked as paid for our reference and can be flagged. 

However; what would be helpful is even more criteria options to narrow our searches and results. 
1) Options could include the ability to only view claims that are currently flagged. 
2) Claims by a particular person/provider, maybe even including a search bar that can pick up on words or names.
3) Claims up/down from to certain criteria, like amount owed, billed, or settled and claims found to be more or less than an amount set by us. 
Example: search for “amount billed/you may owe” claims that $500/+ or $7,000 and below.

It would also be helpful if each claim had a couple more options on how to make/separate them. 
Instead of just simple flagging a claim or checking the Paid box, perhaps more options such as..
a) ‘Watching/TBD’ for claims needing to be checked back on often or are important.
b)‘Re-processing/ disputing ’ for claims needing to be re-processed, or disputed, or being waited on for changes,  

And one last thing, it gets confusing when a on the complete list of all your claims, there will appear 2 or even 3 other identical claims but appear to have be reprocessed and May now show no balance owed, or that insurance has now covered the expenses. 
It’s very confusing having to match up each of these original and their new status doubles by scrolling up and down on a phone to compare claims or just in general.
Each claims has a unique # but it’s tedious to have to find the new claim to the original to confirm insurance had now covered the cost amount or that the claims been successfully reprocessed.

That’s why I say some kind of more in depth search option or sorting method would be helpful to find the particular claim(s) you’re looking for, quicker and without mistake, (like searching up an actual claim number as an option)  

Just some things that frustrate me when I use the app, and wish would be a little different or a little bit of improvement, some possible refining of already existing features. 
Otherwise, I can’t complain. 
The app is very usual, very helpful and I’m appreciate of its existence.

As of 3/14/2020 RenewActive problem with App has been fixed! It was very simple to connect the tracker on my with the program. This now makes it seamless, and increases the incentive to move each day! Thank you to the UHC mobile team for all of the work you put into this. I’m sure members like me greatly appreciate this!

I’m going to give it a 3 (up from 1) until I can test out how the tracking function works for the RenewActive’s rewards program. They have fixed it where that is now part of the app(I’m impressed), so I just want to make sure it can “actually” track my steps. I will change my rating when that’s done.

New-2/14/2020

It has been a couple of weeks and there is no progress on getting the app functioning correctly. When I login to the app it is still showing “incorrect, old” member I’d and group number info.

When I go to the menu, RenewActive is still not there as an option to choose for tracking steps. This is a feature that the United HealthCare refers their customers/clients to for their rewards program.

Old-This is the app that Renew Active uses for tracking steps for rewards with the UnitedHealthcare plan. Renew Active does not appear on the menu as it shows/says on the Renew Active site. So it appears this app does not function as a tracker. I sent this review over the weekend. I also complained that the app is showing the wrong group number and member id for me. The people at UHC tech support told me they are working “aggressively” to correct this as they have received many complaints and questions. 
Yesterday I received an email telling me to “logout and log back in” and everything should be fine. Nothing has changed so far. Please fix this app! I think it would really be a convenient thing to use!",Functionality,2020-03-24 17:11:55,5,mltylou,,,
