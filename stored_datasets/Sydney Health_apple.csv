I downloaded this app and now it has taken 3 calls to Customer Service to get this basic task done.

I log in yesterday and it says it was denied although I had more than enough in there. I tried it again, same transaction. Got all the way to the end screen saying “submitted”. Checked back about an hour later (typically when I do this, it takes the funds out of my balance within seconds), funds were all still there. I look in pending transactions and my recent bill pay submission isn’t there. I waited and checked back today- it’s like it never happened. This app allows you to go all the way to the submit screen, submit it, tells you you’re all set, but meanwhile is doing absolutely nothing. I called customer service and they were dumbfounded, telling me “oh if it said you submitted it then you did but I don’t see it here. Can you do it on the phone with me now? It should show up in real time.”
I go through all of the steps for a third time, nothing shows up. No pending transaction.

Patrick McCusker,2022-02-08 17:23:42,False,"Tried using the chat with a doctor feature a few weeks back. The robot asks a bunch of questions, asks for your credit card information, then directs you into a meaningless void where nothing takes place or crashes, sometimes both. Then the process repeats. For maximum fun, it charged me for the privilege of being angry at a robot while trying to find healthcare. I called Anthem for support and I am now on call number 2, over an hour in, 2 ish hours combined between 4 people in 3 different departments and we have yet to agree on whether the Sydney app can charge patients in the first place. Does Anthem know they have an app? If so, the people answering the phone to help troubleshoot/refund for the app not working should: A: know how the app works, B: know how to handle customer service calls for the app, C: know they have an app called Sydney that can charge patients for “services”. I honestly would have chalked this up to “company started a tech initiative they can’t/don’t know how to support” thing all healthcare providers are up to these days if the customer service wasn’t sooooooooo baaaaad.

Dboyes99,2020-03-24 20:12:18,False,"It’s nice that Anthem is trying new ideas, but this is one of the worst user interfaces I’ve ever seen, and it’s very frustrating to use or guess what to do next. 

First, I have no interest in having a conversation with an app. There are a strictly limited number of things this app needs to do: show me my ID card, show me my claims and pharmacy info, show me what I owe and give me a way to pay it without switching to another app, and request a callback to handle anything more complicated. KISS design needs 4 buttons to do the above. The ID card function needs to store the card locally so you don’t have to be constantly connected to show some office admin your current insurance info. This version makes me guess what a not very well trained AI is looking for and then have an extended discussion with the app to get any useful information while you’re standing at a window.

Suggestion for developers: make a point to stand on one leg with crutches and no weight allowed on the other foot, or put your arm in a sling with nothing to hang onto while trying to find your ID card without assistance; you’ll get the picture quickly why that this app is not an improvement.
Automatic fail if you fall or unbalance yourself - and then we’ll talk.

clelldeaver,2019-12-03 23:33:42,False,"Someone referred to this app’s 5-star reviews as “astroturfing.” I wasn’t familiar with the term, the definition seems very applicable to this app. There is no way this app could have received so many legitimate 5-star ratings right out of the gate (many of which were curiously grouped largely during the period from Aug 30 to Sept 3). Then the tone changes during Oct-Dec where 1-star ratings are much more common than any others. Was this app even beta-tested? The standard response from the developers is “we will continue to release upgrades frequently to provide users with an even more robust and enjoyable user experience” followed by “please provide us with specific examples of problems you experienced so that we can address them.” That really should not be necessary. Users should not be forced to serve as beta-testers; that should be done pre-release.",1,No way the 5-star reviews are legit,,,

Yes, I do log in every day to the app and it will show “no data” for my steps and sleep, even thought my Apple Health data has my steps and sleep time. I always click on the refresh button but that doesn’t change the result, it remains “no data”. Must be bad coding. This issue has been happening since I started using the app months ago.

The info in the app is not sufficient for basics such as looking up doctors or checking benefit and eligibility. 

What a shame because the phone customer service is absolutely horrid.  Calls drop, phone quality is bad, it takes so long to get to the precise person who can help and they ask twenty questions before you can get to what you want.  

I was on the phone 5 times today just so I could get a very very basic piece of information. The last person kept me on hold for 20 minutes checking on something. Then the line dropped.  Before that, The line was bad, and rep promised to call back and never did.  Wasted a whole morning.

Josh-in-Denver,2019-12-26 23:55:00,False,"I was able to register successfully using my membership ID, which seems to indicate that the app should know what my plan is. However, I cannot view my plan information. Instead, it gives me an alert telling me to go to the Anthem website. The “find care” feature is also broken for the same reason. It will not allow me to search because it cannot find my plan. After visiting the Anthem website, I noticed the find care feature there is the exact same page as what is loaded into the app. It’s broken there for the same reason too (cannot find plan), but unlike the app I can actually view my plan information on the site. Neither bug makes much sense and the alert to “go to the website” is not only rude, but nonsensical since the app is already loading pages from that very same website!

About the security issue, I don’t know what high school student was hired to write the registration forms, but I am a highly experienced app developer myself, and those forms appear to have been written by a greenhorn. Literally every field on the forms is obfuscated like it’s a password field, but at least there is an option to de-obfuscate the inputs. Form validation also seems to kick in prematurely, but doesn’t seem buggy. Password restrictions here are the absolute worst- not because they are too strict, but oddly enough, they are not strict enough. I attempted to put in one of my most secure password combinations which is over 20 characters long and includes special characters, but is was rejected as not secure until I put in what is probably one of my LEAST secure passwords! One last thing, it’s good that I de-obfuscated the email address field because I typo’d it initially and apparently there is no email address verification email sent.

This app appears to be a hastily slapped together hodgepodge of an existing buggy website with only the thin veneer of an app placed on top of it.",5,"Bugged out, practically useless, and bad security",,,

Go4bach,2021-10-28 11:10:19,False,"I love the idea of this app, but there are big problems.  1) if you want to chat with a doctor, you wait for hours and then if you are in the middle of something when it is your turn, you lose your opportunity. The time predictor is wildly inaccurate by hours.  And because of the way it notifies you (see more about that later) you might not even get a timely chance to join the doctor in the app for the appointment.  2) the doctors depend heavily on the camera app, which is horrible. My phone has 4 cameras, but there is no way to switch to the zoom or wide angle camera and there is no way to force the flash.  Even if you have somebody else to take a photo for you, and even if they have a flashlight to sub for the flash, it can still be impossible to get a photo that is meaningful to the doctor. 3) there are numerous dead end screens when there is no way to exit a screen other than by closing the app and starting over. 4) when a new message comes in from your doctor, they text your emergency contact instead of you. 5) messages are terribly delayed in the app. The doctor sends you a response, your emergency contact gets a text, and 15-30 minutes later, the message shows up in your app. 6) this means that you may spend days instead of minutes communicating with the doctor and waiting to see if they can help - the whole time, you are not feeling well and the cure could be minutes away if you could just have a few moments of prompt communication. 7) the symptom checker isn’t great. If you type something in that it doesn’t recognize, there is no way to register that symptom. You end up abandoning symptoms that the app doesn’t recognize. Some of the follow up questions have possible answers that are not listed. 8) after your visit, you are asked how it went.

J in CO,2022-03-02 16:58:26,False,"When it works it seems to do well.  Finding providers, seeing claims, checking some coverages, and even the Sydney AI.  Problem is that 75% of the time when we need it something is not working.  Usually driven by an update that needs to happen or one that broke something.  My wife and I now just laugh because it is never working right.  We know now when something isn’t working you need to update the app.  Then when it still isn’t working right you need to wait a few more days as another update will happen a few days later.  

Problem is when you are on the road and only on cellular then it is not so easy to update the app.  Slow data rates and uses too much data. 

Latest example:  was working fine for about a few weeks - we were shocked - which was good as were in the middle of care.  Then I go to log in today and “a something has gone wrong.”  I update it and now it fails sending a code.  “Oops something went wrong” and “too many tries” or something like that.  Now I just have to wait for another update.

RobMorgan33,2021-08-31 11:50:14,False,"I’ve had an issue recently where I could not pay my plan premium at the beginning of the month. When I was finally able to do so, the app had doubled all of my premiums. In the past, I was able to call and have this resolved with the billing department with no issues and it was fixed within a day. 

This month (August 2021) when I called, the billing department told me last week that I was being billed for October and that I could only pay the premium over the phone by giving out my credit card number which I was not comfortable with as I did not trust who I was speaking with and based on the fact that they insisted that I pay over the phone instead of correcting the mistake in the app to keep my account up to date.

It made no sense as the app would still reflect a passed due notification for a bill that was for the future, not September’s bill but October’s bill! 

They told me they would contact their technical support… when I called back this week (last week of August) I spoke with the same person as last week who told me it was September’s bill this time that was being applied early (after going over the issue with her again) and when I told her that 24-48 hours may be too long to resolve the issue and insisted on paying through the app, she stopped talking. When she finally started talking again, she told me no one had entered any details in the report to technical support (meaning she didn’t do what she said she would). She made me wait for a supervisor, then transferred the call to someone else who admitted they were working off shore.

Couldn’t tell if I was being scammed at this point (based on the conversation and what I’ve seen on YouTube on how people scam people through computer hacks) and the supervisor would not help me out either.

As I mentioned before, I was behind on my payment but in the past the double billing was resolved. This time it wasn’t. Not sure what to think of Anthem’s billing department at this point but having noticed the change in billing procedure (doubled in the app) and the change in how they would accept my payment over the phone only, I believe there is a potential that my app and/or account information was not in good hands.",1,Constantly being billed for next month before the current month ends,24876492.0,"Hello, thank you for sharing your experience with us.

This app is unusually poor quality. The app name doesn’t work even have the word “anthem” in it; so finding it when the website was down to download my card was difficult. Then you get to the login page and just see “Sydney” with no indication that you can use your anthem web login. So I thought to create a new account. When I did that, there isn’t even a control to add birthday to registration form nor can I copy paste it from somewhere else. So I went back to login with anthem credentials which worked. 

Once I was inside the app, I needed to download my insurance card to iCloud Drive so I could send it off to somebody who needs it. So I clicked the “download card” option. All that does is save it to the app? You can’t use the iOS share panel nor can you save the card to iCloud Drive: you can only email or fax(???) it.

Those data should be easily accessible through the website and app using filter options and report exporting, like every other bank and credit card service I use, yes? 
Not so much. Not at all. 

It took a several phone calls, first to the app people then to the customer service center. That was the first 15 minutes. Once I got to someone who could help, she had to create the report while I waited. It took more than 50 minutes. Then she had to send it by email using a secure link. She did not have the correct instructions for me to open it; then put me on hold for another 15 minutes during which our phone call dropped. Got disconnected. Never to be connected again. 

I got the email eventually and was able to open it, but it only had a fraction of the data I wanted (just the medical premiums, but I carry vision and dental too.) And we never even got to the payments for services report. 
Of course, I was speaking with someone who had an Indian accent, and of course, they can’t give you their direct line number, so to get what I want, I’d have to go through the whole thing again?? I think not. 

SOOO FREAKIN’ MADDENING. I should have the capability to access that information by myself without through the portal anyway, yes? Why is that not possible?What else is the portal used for?? I’ve had no other use for it. 

And, of course, I am a single-payer, self-insured person with limited provider options. So this means I have to just accept this level of poor customer service?!!? Just so wrong.
