I  have several doctors and each seems to have their own portal and very few use the portals to best advantage like sharing information if the share an zan app like Healow. So it remains a hard place to navigate information. But‚Ä¶ My Health One  is the two year summary of all my hospital, or urgent care visits. One place. Thank you very much for quieting the issues and making it  easy to find dates and doctors.

"The app started out working great. My youngest son recently had to be seen, and they gave me the instructions on how to get him linked to my acct.. linking to one acct (would be the 5 ‚≠êÔ∏èfor me, bc no one wants to login & keep up with all the login user info w/multiple accts). However, when he was first linked up, things were great.. he was linked on the 17th (day after visiting the ER), then on the 26th (day after getting sonogram images done) his info (ALL OF IT), just disappeared. I called the number, and spoke with someone, who found it odd, couldn‚Äôt give me the reason why his info just disappeared. Yet we could both see he was still linked to my acct. I know it‚Äôs not some random malfunction for the day, bc my med records are still there to view. So, it got sent over to tech support‚Ä¶. and currently the issue isn‚Äôt resolved. Side note: I also went into the web browser version, and the same problem is happening there that I am having with the app. All his hospital info is just GONE.

I need to get Covid results for my son but it‚Äôs only showing me results for myself. The location in Dickinson told me to download the app and I should find my sons test results there. However she did not explain how to obtain those results. I tried creating an account in his name but I was unable to so I have no idea how to get his results. The app does not explain if you can add dependents or not. Now I have to drive to the Care Now location to pick up my sons Covid results in order for him to return to school. I was originally told to download the LabCorp app and the results would be downloaded there. I did and his results are still not there. I was Covid positive over a month ago and my results are still not in LapCorp. So I have now downloaded two apps and neither can give me the documentation I need.,CareNow- Horrible,1,2021-09-22 14:34:28,Patient Test Results,False,"We are sorry to hear you've had trouble accessing your son's results.
