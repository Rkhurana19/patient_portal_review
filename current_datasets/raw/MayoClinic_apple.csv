A pretty easy and inclusive app… except for ONE thing,4,False,"This app is amazing in that you can set up appointments, see your appointment schedule, see your lab results and even converse with your medical team. It is failing in one aspect for me that would put it over the top: including a way to add appointments into ones own iCal, google, Hotmail, yahoo, whatever calendar without them having to do so manually. For a patient such as myself, when I have a FULL days worth of appointments, I’d like to be able to transfer it into my own calendar seamlessly so I may schedule work/events around it. As of now I’m having to add a full days worth of appointments (more than 7) individually and manually instead of it just syncing up or copying to my calendar. If you can add this feature, that would be AMAZING- Thank you!",Nikkideez,2021-09-13 21:17:25,,,
Navigating the Mayo system,3,False,I love Mayo and we have been with it since we lived in Minnesota. But once we moved to Scottsdale we could not move our primary care doctor here to Mayo in that we were over 65. That was a low blow after being with Mayo in Rochester and having all of our medical care there for years. The other thing I find is that the Mayo system is difficult to navigate. Until you’re the one doing all of the navigating you don’t realize the difficulty involved. Because they do not take Medicare you have to pay the bills and never seem to match the payment schedule and so I put an XL spreadsheet together and put took it to the finance department. He told me that it is impossible to use the spreadsheet to figure out pay and even he had difficulty explaining it to me. That being said I still think it’s the finest medical facility in Arizona but it certainly is difficult to navigate. On the website I find that if you request a response from the medical team you will get a quick response. I also find they telemedicine more and not being able to meet with doctors. I also find that PAs and MPs are meeting with you rather than doctors more often. I find them taking extraordinary Covid precautions and felt very safe once I got into the facility.,kayaklafy,2020-07-17 16:48:47,,,
World’s Best Healthcare,5,False,"We return each year to Mayo for our annual physicals, and we always have a nice experience considering the reason we are in Rochester. We find the doctors, nurses, and staff so helpful, kind and wonderful in their care for my husband and me. It is the best care one could find! Though we spend our winters in Scottsdale and knowing there is a Mayo’s there, we still favor having the physicals in Rochester. Through the years we have had other family members needing surgery and Mayo was our choice to go and again we were very pleased with the remarkable help from the doctors, nurses and staff we received. Our biggest disappointment was finding that my doctor of 15 years is apt to retire next year.  He has been the best and I’ve especially appreciated the wonderful care he has given. He has been so helpful and does his work well and gives us the impression he has all the time in the world for us even though we know it is not true. We were sorry to hear this as he will be greatly missed by us. I have greatly appreciated having him for my doctor.",nana Ava,2020-10-23 16:58:56,,,
Good start but needs work!,2,False,"Sometimes it opens, often it doesn’t. As I am legally blind, it’s hard for me to read the info. In particular, the patient number is written SO small I have to give it to others to ask them to read it. (So much for patient confidentiality- I’d rather they just leave it so I can enlarge it. (I need minimum font size 14 to read but normally use 18 to avoid strain- I believe yours is about 8). Color change would help as well. I can change my iPad to go white on black nos like this note, but cannot change the app background. These things have caused great issue problems for me including overpayment by me which Mayo Clinic still has not resolved. If I had been able to read the note, it would have been avoided completely.   Set up doesn’t allow for patients to put their own notes - something which would allow better exchange with doctors as things come up between visits, it also (like most medical portals) doesn’t allow for information exchange by the patient with other non-mayo doctors. Until doctors demand that portals be able to exchange info, medical treatment in this country will continue to erode. You are in a good position to do so. Use the reputation of Mayo Clinic under the Mayo brothers and demand better for your patients!",LadyCharlane,2020-01-15 21:12:25,,,
Some features great and others poor,3,True,"This app is very handy and i use it frequently. Like adding appointments to calendar feature. But both website and app neglect the ability to pay by visit selectively. This means bills get much later payment while some are pending on insurance payments...this is bad for Mayo cashflow.

I might add that each time I have called and paid by specific visits the Mayo clerk agrees that they get many callers requesting to pay in this manner yet nothing has been done about it. One would think that the operating costs associated with phone support for billing in this manner (many times it can be 10+ minutes) would easily justify the changes to incorporated it. For example the website already lists the bills by visit number yet it does not provide the means to pay them individually. So this is just not an app problem.

I suspect the problem is that they do accounting of charges and credits by an account and not by individual bills to an account. But since they go through the effort to address bills individually they should have the means to implement payment by bill(visits).",Matenai,2018-08-14 00:19:21,Matenai - thanks for the kind words about the app.  I’ve passed your feedback along to our billing area so they can consider improving that experience for users in the future.

"For me, they need to be more direct.",3,False,"While I highly recommend this app/site, and have often go gone to it as a first source of information for medical issues, for me, they pull too many punches.
    If you want a more direct, and quite possibly more emotionally challenging take on a medical issues, I highly recommend the Medscape app. 
     Having said that, I have a lot of respect for this app. It’s a very good entry point for basic medical information. Kindness, and patient empathy, are very important. And many people people are not comfortable with more direct clinical information.
    As an example, if you ever are faced with a serious medical situation, and a doctor recommends an invasive treatment, ask them not just what the odds of success and failure (death) are. Ask them what the success, failure and morbidity are. Morbidity is often a big slice of the pie, and that means that the physicians tried, and actually made things worse. Asking about morbidity will change the nature of the conversation with the medical community.

Review #2 of: “A Godsend for chronic patients!!”,5,False,"I still feel the same way I did when I rated 3 years ago, absolutely have no idea how I was able to navigate my own health care I Since then this app has taken full advantage of the ever increasing capabilities of cellular phones. There are several new ways it’s made the patients feel more in control of our own health care direction and decisions. Off the top of my head some new capabilities are: faster and simpler ways to communicate with drs, I can schedule and cancel appointments online with very little to no need to
Speak with anyone, I can be contacted by my drs and/or their nurse(s) when they need to reach me, ex. to add to something we discussed at an earlier appt, etc.. Just makes me feel more confident and in control, which is priceless when 1 or several health problems seem to take that control away.",Baijley,2021-04-14 06:28:58,,,
MAYO KNOWS APPS! THIS IS GREAT!,5,False,"The best and most useful app of all!
And if there’s a glitch they don’t waste time fixing it!!!! They continually surveil it and check for proper operation. It’s a dang good virtual tool for all health needs & keeping in touch with your care team. Billing information and payment ability (even the option to set up payment plans) is right there too! This is THE BEST and well-maintained app in the store!!!!!

PS... you can also contact their tech team directly via phone! That is sure different and comforting. They truly care!!!! All apps should be so wonderful! Apple should mandate this type service with all its apps allowed on their App Store!!!!! Unfortunately they don’t seem to care except to collect their share…we all know how impossible it is to get any tech support with most every app that Apple allows to be available on their Store!!!",TITANIUMPATRIOT,2022-01-20 07:08:42,,,
Was a useful app,1,False,"Getting past and reporting bugs is impossible. If a person is expected to use an app provided to access and report bugs and app issues, there should be an open line to IT to report bugs and issues and not some roadblock. I have done all possible troubleshooting steps I can and still cannot access the app's reporting feature…thus forcing this change in rating. If they were simple issues I wouldn't bother complaining. However, when the app makes it impossible to take surveys, report dates and send bug reports there is a significant issue.

OLD REVIEW: I've recently started using the app. The set up wasn't easy at first (numbers! I hate punching numbers) but after I got logged in and working it has been a champ. A trip to the ER with the app helped me keep abreast of my lab results and allowed me ask the physician good questions about my health and results. There is always room for improvement, like definitions, etc. However, after my initial hassle, this app has been very useful to me when I needed it...thankfully, not often.",books54751,2021-12-28 18:15:32,,,
Autoimmune diseases,5,False,"I am a physician . I am retired. Due to severe  symptom’s of pain in my hands.  Then it went into my feet.  I have always exercised.  I was a gold medal winner at age 6 in a NATIONAL AAU  SWIM MEET, which was part of a five state division, Montana, Minnesota, ND and SD.  I graduated from the U Minn in Mpls.  I went on , as an adult to long distance running and 3x a week of weight lifting.  I then got
Into Joseph Pilates for 15 years until my instructor moved  back to seattle.  I also took vigorous and demanding yoga classes.  Ashstanga, other yoga that extremely demanding.  I went through a year course to train to be a yoga instructor.  Then I took an 18month course to learn accupuncture and Chinese Medicine.  Yet, I am now at a point where walking is a challenge  due to inherited genetic problems.  Does anything really work to treat autoimmune problems?  The side effects of autoimmune meds are worse than the diseases they are treating.",Take it as it is,2018-04-19 00:31:11,,,
Undisclosed results and unknown result sources,1,False,"You can have a long list of results and not know what they are referencing. Perhaps you had 10 different tests (blood, lung aspiration, urinalysis and so on) and each test had tested for protein. 
...The lab results will have 10 different protein results but you won't know what assay each are from.
Also:  not every test you go in for will populate to your portal. WHY NOT?!?  It’s my test, I paid... you better let me have the ability to view. This goes for certain pathology tests, neurological exams, fertility tests (including ultrasounds)AND many more!!!!  Why do you (Mayo Clinic) HIDE results from patients?  Why!!!?
I’ve updated review down to one star. You’ve had enough time to fix these issues.  One star is generous.
Notice no developer response to this date because for some reason Mayo doesn’t want you to have access to your entire result list and won’t attempt to categorize your test results. This is to control the patient, negligence, or do not care about patient needs. Would like to know which of these are/is the reason.",338 479 218,2018-07-29 17:52:30,,,
Not as functional as it should be,1,False,"Firstly, and most importantly, the notifications don’t work. All I receive is a badge on the app when all the possible notifications are selected (banner, sound, etc). To make matters worse, when you open the app to figure out what the badge notification is for, there isn’t any badge or obvious sign anywhere to let me know where to look for the new or changed information. I have to go through each area to figure it out and today, I couldn’t find anything. 

Secondly, the “coach chat” and “experiments” functions NEVER work. It always says “we’re sorry, something happened, but we’ll be back soon” then says to check my network connection. Believe me, my network connection is fine and as many times as I have attempted to use the function, it wouldn’t have been down every single time considering all my other devices work just fine. 

Thirdly, you cannot update anything within the app. I even received a message (after searching for what I was notified for) to update my allergies. I went into the allergy section and there is literally no way to update them. I tried long hold, swiping right, swiping left, and looked for a button to edit, but nothing was working. I waited until my appointment to do it there.

I really wish the notification thing would be fixed ASAP because it causes me the most anxiety that I’m missing something. Calling the Mayo Clinic every time I can’t figure it out is ridiculous.",amknbk,2018-06-07 17:49:22,"Amknbk, sorry the notifications aren’t working well for you.  We know how annoying it is when you expect something to work and it doesn’t.  The badge notifications in the version of the app you’re using are only alerting you to new content available in the Today feed of the app.  In a future build we’ll be enabling badges in the patient tab of the app to alert you to what has changed on your record - we’re not there yet though unfortunately.  So no need to call to figure out if something is changed based on that badge.  

The app doesn’t currently allow updating of medical record content.  We hope to add that in the future.  You can update your allergy information as part of the pre-appointment questionnaires and I suspect that is where that message you received generated from.

For coach chat and experiments - we can help you troubleshoot that - please send us an email with your username and brief description of this issue and we’ll try to help you get this fixed and hopefully improve our app for future versions. Our email is mcmobileapps@mayo.edu.  Thank you.",3930958.0,2018-06-21T20:00:42Z
Indispensable,4,False,"This app it’s a must-have for anyone going to Amati for a complex evaluation involving more than just an appointment or two. The app is updated in real time, reflecting any changes/additions to or deletions from schedule, test results, visit notes. You can also review and pay your bill, send messages and questions to your care team, check in for appointments, and more.

Why, then, not five stars? 1) In a couple of cases,, the app required me to go to the Web for full information. 2) App tech support and my medical team do not have a common understanding of the app’s capacity to accommodating patient uploads of documents.",JDATL,2020-07-10 22:46:44,,,

He had an echo done and had me wear a Holter for 24 hours. I was told I had arterial fibrillation and he doubled my Ditazelem and put me on Eliquis twice a day. I asked when he would be seeing me again and he said “Oh you’re fine. See you in 6 months.” But I’m not fine. My heart still feels funny.

Appointments that can be RELIABLY added to your calendar directly from the app,  procedure descriptions along with instructions and notifications, the ability to directly message members of your care team, lab findings, health reports, etc., etc.

I only wish other apps worked like this. As a Mayo patient I strongly recommend downloading this app as it can really make life so much easier in a world where us patients have so much else to worry about.

In many cases it is required to have, as I have many appointments that get scheduled with absolutely no notification from Mayo. Luckily I pay attention to this app when I’m expecting a call to schedule an appointment, because it’s the only way I’d know.

The web version of Mayo’s patient portal does not work with anything except internet explorer, so the app is convenient for bill pay, when it works. The majority of the time the screen tries to zoom in and the user loses any action buttons that might appear. When I can get to the point of entering my information, there is no continue/submit payment button.

Good functionality but major flaws exist,3,False,"This app is loaded with good functionality, but there are big flaws where it matters most. My main issue is around notifications. I have enabled push notifications for appointments both in the app and via iOS settings; however, I never receive notifications regarding my appointments. No upcoming appointment reminders, no notifications of appointments being scheduled, etc.. it has caused me to miss appointments I was never knew were scheduled for me.

Help,2,False,"Too much fluff has been added to the app in which in most cases, has nothing to do with an individual’s own personal healthcare. To make matters worse, alerts to the app are received without any indication as to what the alert was for once inside the app. Did your medical records just get updated, a new message to you chart get added, or was a non-health related recipe just added? I think the patient portal should remain exactly that. If Mayo wants to put recipes out that pertains to the general public, then a new app should be made exclusively for that purpose and the patient portal should be enhanced for the individual patient.

I show up and call to check in, they said I am not on their schedule. Told me 90% of people that schedule on app it goes away, and NOW we are to call and go through the nurse to check at symptoms which is what they did months ago, then told us to use the app. I was told I should have gone back in the app to verify the appointment. I don’t have time to check if a app worked made for a multi million dollar company in the year 2021.",ray_ray88,2021-10-28 16:37:42,,,

Please try again.” I attempted to use the reset password link but was unsuccessful. I was able to login to the website and change my password successfully, however I still was unable to use the new password in the app. The new password works in the website and the previous version of the app still installed on a different device.

Priceless access to medical records,5,False,"I can’t keep track of paper documents for the life of me! This app is priceless in managing my medical records!

Sending a message to provider via the Portal,2,False,"Why am I no longer to select the medical provider whom I want to send a private confidential message to???  Now it appears all my inquires go to ALL the providers my son has had in the past.  Today, I was messaging his surgical team attempting to answer a post op follow up question.  It appeared that this message went to EVERYONE he's seen in the past for different conditions!  I don't like that.

Edit: the Touch ID feature did not appear after I initially logged in, but after deleting & reinstalling app a couple of times it finally did.  I’ll change my rating to a 3 because I still like the old app better - I like having a portal just for my patient info.

Mayo App evaluation,5,False,"I have used the Mayo App for 7-8 years.  Your questionnaires provide little to no feedback by patients.  I have a plethora of health issues, most caused by my genetic predisposition to develop neuroendocrine tumors.

I felt like i was back in 1980 in the freshmen College dorm. I believe if a more stable/comfortable bed was available i believe that it could result in a more accurate results.

I miss the old version.,2,False,"Version 4 is much slower than version 3. The previous person was an absolutely excellent app from my perspective. It was very rapid and responsive. Especially with the thumbprint login. This new one does not allow me to login with my thumbprint and it takes longer to get to the information I need.

Great App!,5,False,"You don’t have to be a patient to use this app. It has so many useful features that are added everyday yet it’s not overwhelming.

Must have app,5,False,If you are a patient at Mayo this app is great at managing appointments. After every appointment your doctor will put everything in writing and you can read it all again when you get home. Very helpful because I never remember everything said in the exam room.,1928 Timmy,2018-12-29 01:45:55,,,
New changes not great,2,False,"I have been using the app portal to communicate with my doctors and nurses post organ transplant. It was much better before the latest changes. The app just seems to give the patient far less medical information specifically their labs results.  Now I just get a lab result figure with no frame of reference as to whether it’s good or bad. Used to get result with the expected range from low to high under it, which allowed me to figure out if The number was good or bad",fitguy2012,2018-09-24 17:59:43,,,
Help,2,False,I have special needs child. This app works perfectly and is a blessing to be able to switch back and forth from her account to mine! I LOVE everything at my fingertips! I rated 2 only because 90 percent of our records have disappeared. Please I need to look back to 2016 sometime to see what doctor said about next test. Was it 3 years ? 5 years ?

Great Tool!,5,False,"I love this app and was so glad when Mayo Clinic added this to all the other amazing things they do. Over time, I have utilized the e-check in, appointment portal, messaging, pre-appointment questionnaires, lab results, imaging, etc. It has been a fantastic resource for me and like the Mayo Clinic itself, I’m thankful to have had it!",Mishi2,2020-03-25 03:35:33,,,
New version is inferior for medical communication,1,False,"I loved the previous app and used it to communicate with my physicians.  I also used it to retrieve the notes of my exams. 

I cannot print any notes of my meetings with my physicians. I used to be able to.

I tried sending a message through messages.  No record of my message exists .  Terrible.

 I do not use this app for recipes or any of the pretty magazine junk you are filling it with.  I used it to communicate with my physicians and for the invaluable record of my exams and procedures.  I could have an exam and not worry about taking notes during it.

This new nightmare app does not allow me to print notes of my exams or keep a record of messages to and from my physicians.

Is this a patient app or a magazine?   I hate this new mess. Make it a medical app again.",JDBMSP,2018-05-10 19:33:04,,,

Best health app out there,5,True,"This app has so much useful health information backed by the most prestigious medical organization in our galaxy.

Too much incorrect information making it a unacceptable resource for patient information.,1,False,"Patient information is being rewritten for online app use rendering it worse than useless .
Doctors are using this and not seeing correct patient information. It’s a horrible oversight on Mayo’s technical part. Have updated and corrected my own historical information only to find it still not corrected. Worse than useless!",geekgirl2,2021-07-26 16:21:48,,,
App does not contain updated medical test results,1,False,"My cancer retesting was done today and my doctor told me that she would send me the results via the portal. My wife was notified via email that results were available and by going into my records via the Web she found my test results. There was nothing in the App portal with my results. This has been anxious times for me and I have been waiting all day for my results. The App patient information, test results and letters are not in sync.",skfgoldwing,2019-12-09 23:30:33,,,
MAYO MAKES BIG MISTAKE!,1,False,"Previous versions of this app gave ALL lab results.  This version shows ONLY the latest result for each lab test.  This is a very bad change!  How can i see any trend in critical values when you only report the latest value??  

For example, I was at recently at Mayo Clinic and on doctor’s orders returned 3 weeks later after changing medications.   The difference in GFR and Creatinine values between these two dates was the whole point of a second visit.  Of similar interest are values from my labs in 2004, which are used as a “baseline” for me.  You now only report from 2004 the lab tests that have not been repeated more recently.  This makes no sense!  

Please correct this mistake, or provide an option for a patient to see ALL results.  Thank you.

Used to be great..no longer,2,False,My husband and I have used this app since it came into being but in the last year or two we are unable to switch between the two accounts in the app. Very aggravating as it takes multiple attempts to switch accounts on the mobile app. Sure hope it is fixed someday.,Nana Words,2022-04-17 08:23:47,,,

EXCELLENT APP!,5,False,This app is awesome!!  They update your records the second it gets into their system.

Vital signs never work,2,False,I liked the old app better. It was more user friendly. Vital signs in my app never work. It states the following message. “We’re sorry.

I received an email requesting I fill out a questionnaire prior to my appointment and to use echeckin.  The email directions guided me to options that were not present.

Convenient,5,False,"This app is very easy to use! It’s great in terms of tracking you appointment, knowing how to prepare for appointments, and reading medical notes.

Functional but needs some work!,3,False,"It’s not a bad app, served the purpose while I was at Mayo.

Billing,2,False,"I am 75 years old so that could be my problem, but I cannot understand the billing electronically.

Lost chart function is no upgrade,2,False,"Until the latest revision, I was able to view labs with historical charts. The history is still there but not grouped by lab test; they’re listed now by date. So if I want to compare the same lab results, I have to scroll endlessly and write down each result before I search for the next date. I loved the previous version. This one is unfortunate.",Franks8519,2018-08-04 20:05:20,,,

Had no issues logging in until about two weeks ago.  

“Update”

Not very functional,2,False,I have tried to use this app but find that the messaging is too generic - I should be able to choose my physician - which is probably why my messages go unanswered for up to a week - the lab results are just a long list - overall navigation is not very user friendly - if you made it more like MyChart it would be great,Hfritz,2018-08-07 17:03:57,,,

Missing Patient Information,1,False,This new app was a failed attempt to improve cosmetics and appear more professional.

Good information but poor design,2,False,This app seems to have been designed by an inferior IT department. Some basic user functionality is missing .

Not Great,1,False,"App is awkward and non-intuitive. Many things just don’t work. “Click here for questionnaire” pops you to a screen to download the app (which you’re already in).  Appointment “ordered” for Cologuard and the schedulR writes, “check your appointment guide” - but after 10 minutes of rabbit-holing, can’t find that anywhere. Mayo is great for patient care.

I don't have much experience with the app just yet but so far I am impressed with the ease of use and the information it contains already about my husband's statistics and appointments. It even showed me a new appointment we didn't have on our printed schedule. I do understand some of the ""helpful"" criticisms in the other reviews, but I anticipate future improvements in the areas of ability to send messages to specific people (but maybe not since every CEO has a team of front people who sort out the necessary from the time-wasting) and in the area of billing. With the current structure, however, I am initially very impressed by its immediate usefulness to a new patient.",mizzaka,2016-09-27 13:42:35,,,
Mayo Clinic,4,False,Since I am not a patient certain features of this application are closed to me but just as a normal non affiliated user the Mayo Clinic can still be beneficial.

The app can also be used to get directions to any of the three clinics in the United States. I did not see a daily health news section as a non user but since the app allows you the option to create an account that feature as well as others will most likely become available.,D.

Love the Apple watch app,5,False,"Simple and to the point. I flew to Mayo clinic from out of state for a series of tests and exams for a surgery. The watch app provided just enough information for each appointment and where I needed to go for these appointments. 
Mayo Clinic building complex is pretty big and can be a bit overwhelming. The watch app made my Mayo experience a sweat-free one. If I could be extra picky, then it would be to bring users directly into the appointment swipe view if it is the only thing that they have. I have to tap the only button ""appointments"" on the home screen every time I come into the watch app, even though it was the only option available to me.

I also love the support for Touch ID on the phone app for signing in.",vinpsf,2015-05-28 16:41:35,,,
What an app should be!,5,False,"Like the title says this is what an app should be. This app compliments your visit to Mayo Clinic both before and after. It allows you see all of your health record and to communicate with your care teams - it's a must for anyone visiting a Mayo Clinic site. You can really tell that the team that works on this app takes a lot of pride in developing a quality product - kudos to the team. 

P.S. I wish all apps that were put out by Mayo Clinic were made this well. I downloaded both the diet app and the book app and they both were done very poorly. It looks like those apps were not developed by Mayo Clinic and subsequently not done very well. I expect more out of an institution like Mayo Clinic.",BruceBrody,2017-01-17 22:16:39,,,
STAY away - lost data & messaging broken,2,False,"For over a year now, the Mayo Clinic iPad Application will not let you create a message.  It opens the keyboard and you can type away - but it never appears on the screen.

There are also cases where messages from the clinic have the entire message stripped off, so all you can see is the title and sender.  These messages appear fine in their web version.

I've seen this on iPad Air v1/2 and older iPads.  It is across all the current iOS updates from today 10 June 2015 back a full year, AND the latest App Releases going back a year.

I've even called their IT group for help, which they said 'would be investigated'

This is just very basic functionality.  The fact they miss this in testing - repeatedly - makes me question the accuracy of everything else they are reporting.  Missing part or all of a message from your physicians can be life threatening.  For me, it messed up post spine surgery care.   That's not trivial.

My advice is to STAY AWAY and use the web interface, which is accurate, has more functionality, and extremely robust.

I suppose this was out-sourced off country to save money, but Shame on Mayo for not testing their SW better and Shame on them for letting it slide.",untakennickname337,2015-06-11 17:14:00,,,
Phenomenal. Mayo never ceases to be the best,5,False,"I normally don't take time to send feedback or reviews, but I have to say (given, I'm biased, having worked for Mayo) this app is phenomenal. Sure, there are little things to improve (e.g., it would be nice to have information to propagate to the Health app's emergency card, but I realize this probably gets tangled in HIPAA to some degree), but this app and Mayo's approach are clearly the future of healthcare. As someone whose career is majorly directed toward trying to develop these same technological advances for mental health and illness and self-monitoring and treatment, I wholly appreciate this app both as a consumer and professional. THANK YOU!",whatisakeagan,2014-10-02 07:17:29,,,
Awesome App,5,False,"I read through a few reviews and it appears that others have already expressed my joy with the Mayo app.  It is so intuitive and has every feature I could think of with the exception of being able to print my vitals from mobile app. I don't see an option for printing. ???
Note:  For the reviewer (Inconsistent) that is having issues with log in, connection, etc., I have never experienced these problems on my iPhone or iPad, but I can imagine the frustration.",Docs Christian wife,2016-04-13 17:02:45,,,
Good App When It Works,2,False,"I believe the app has good intentions but still needs to improve. I can not send messages more times than not, I can't access ER records which should be part of notes and documents as there is pertinent patient information in these visits, and it takes too long for radiology and pathology reports to show up, after  they have been finalized. 
More information should be shown related to labs when there are notes related to them. Mayo has greatly improved in the transparency process, but still could improve. The surgical side of Mayo outshines the medical side  in all aspects of patient information, speed of contact, and assistance when needed. I've had first hand experience with this.",M&PW,2016-07-20 22:12:45,,,
Great,5,False,"This app is the most comprehensive patient portal I have ever seen. Mayo gives you access to everything, doc notes, vitals, meds, and even the images from radiology scans! While I was in the Mayo ER two days ago I was able to see the results of my blood work on the app even before they came back in and told me them. 

Very helpful app in managing your appointments and everything you have going with Mayo. It integrates with your calendar to save appointments if you want it too as well.",Bnl0,2015-02-11 14:48:48,,,
Wonderful app that seems to keep getting better,5,False,"The ability to see appointments, reports and labs AND to provide feedback to the various care teams advances the Mayo lead over other providers by a huge amount. For those of us that wish to share the results with others, it has been made easy. Feedback to doctors and staff is simplified.  Labs results plotted over time makes it amazingly easy to observe trends and treatment effects. The app is truly transformative.",*Dick*,2016-12-14 21:01:05,,,
Back to the best medical facility app now that ios9 bug is fixed,5,False,This app is the best app I have ever seen for keeping track of medical appointments and can even see your X-rays and other scans. I would still fire their app developer for not being ready for ios9 upgrade. I depend on this app for my appointments and with it down it is very frustrating. But it's working again and is actually something that makes me want to go to mayo over closer hospitals,mletnau,2015-09-28 16:36:46,,,
What you expect from Mayo,5,False,"This app makes receiving and requesting, especially personal, information seamless. I have been a very satisfied patient of Mayo's for almost four years. Yesterday I used this handy app to schedule an appointment. This morning I received a call from Mayo with my appointment time and it had been entered in the app. 
In addition all your records and pertinent information is always available and easy to retrieve.",Larry in AZ,2017-05-03 20:15:49,,,
Best All Around Medical Service,5,False,"We have been blessed to receive medical care at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida since November 2010. 

At a very scary time in our lives, Mayo Clinic provided online answers to our neurological search questions; their medical papers and user friendly online portal was a God sent to us. We basically initiated medical treatment through the Mayo Clinic portal.

We can summarize the extraordinary medical and integrated service from everyone and all departments in two words ""excellence and compassion"". Specialized medical care and follow up appointments have been exceptional.

After God, we thank the Mayo Clinic, Dr. Wharen (neurosurgery) and Dr. Landolfo (cardiovascular surgery), for saving my husband's life. 

Thank you Mayo Clinic, we shall continue our support to you.",Monica Richter,2016-04-28 22:01:37,,,
Great but crashes,2,False,"This app is WONDERFUL. I would be delighted to give it 10 stars if I could. However once it was connected to my calendar it started crashing my iPad as soon as I tried to put the appointment from the app into my calendar.

However, the app did allow me to put my appointments into my calendar on my iPhone perfectly. The only problem is that since the App was installed my phone has decided to reboot itself several times on it's own especially when I am accessing my calendar, even though it has nothing to do with the mayo clinic appointments.",Lynda Lew,2014-10-22 01:05:47,,,
Broken for iOS 9.2 on iPad Air & iPhone 6 Plus,1,False,"I loved the previous versions of the Mayo Clinic app. Today was my first attempt to run the updated app on my iPad Air and iPhone 6 Plus, and it does not work on either device. Both devices are running iOS 9.2 because I have been traveling and don't want to update the iOS while traveling.
     The app lets you log in and appears to be working, but when you select any Patient function (e.g., Lab Results, Appointments), the iOS menu screen appears. When you switch back to the Mayo Clinic app, you are presented with the Mayo log in screen.
     I am hoping this app gets fixed soon.",Bobbi&Bruce,2016-12-03 19:49:06,,,
99.9% thumbs up,5,False,"I like everything about the app but I wish they would send or give care procedures of pre-op instructions before the actual procedure. We missed the call to the house but we were already on our way to Phoenix. It would complete the app, making it whole. Mayo has done a great job in its efforts to provide electrical medical records to the patient. Another great thumbs up for mayo.",Djnsen,2012-11-25 05:47:54,,,
Gone down the tube.,1,False,"I used to use this app a lot to help with reviewing my lab results, making sure I was on time for appointments and various other things. After the upgrade every button I hit either gives me nothing or the chance to request an appointment. I wanted to also use it to tie in with my phone's health app to keep an overall health picture but I can no longer do that either. I gave the app almost a month to get its stuff together and have seen no improvements. I guess mayo does not keep tabs on its apps rather than just trying to get something out here so they can say they have done it.",dwm81,2016-01-11 12:00:02,,,
Wish ALL Providers had this!,5,False,"I don't care what isn't working on it. I can see my patient file! I can see the imaging! I can see my appointments!!! I don't have to remember everything the doc said. I can go look at the visit notes. I LOVE this app!!! Maybe it is supposed to have more/better functionality, but I'm loving it just the way it is. Anything else would be icing on the cake.",huuvola,2016-02-09 00:57:23,,,
Outstanding,5,False,"This app is extremely user-friendly and provides all the data I need and more. It allows me to access all the information I need and then some.

I wish all the doctors applications were as easy, user-friendly and provided as much data as the Mayo clinic does!",Tscot72,2016-11-25 04:03:02,,,
Very usefull,5,False,"Just finished a week of evaluations at Mayo Clinic in Rochester and this app is the absolute must-have app for keeping track of the ever-changing schedules and for instantly looking at the results of tests and what your doctors have written up. 

Easy navigation and easy to print out all your results in PDF format to give your doctors at home. 

Very well done for both iPad and iPhone.",Thompson Hill,2014-04-04 22:25:48,,,
Could be better,3,False,"Love that I can get all the records and notes from visits for me and my kids.  You can see your appointments that are scheduled.  It would be nice if you could add those to your calendar or apple wallet right from the app.  Even just setting up a reminder from the app.  Adding bill pay, and account summary info would be fantastic.  And I would love to be able to contact my primary care physician directly instead of just a ""care team"".",a.gillette,2016-09-18 17:00:06,,,
Great app,5,False,"The Mayo Clinic app is great! I love that I can see pathology reports (like an X-ray) on my phone! Such an easy and intuitive app with all the functions you need.

I've used Epic's and it just isn't as good. Lacks features compared to Mayo such as pathology reports, graphs for lab results, and is in general inconveniently designed. 

Thank you Mayo for proving such a great app for myself and other patients out there!",SunnyDes,2017-05-13 00:30:17,,,
Can't read my messages,3,False,"The app is great and easy to use on both iPhone and iPad except that messages don't open correctly. I can see that I have a message, but it comes up blank when I click on it to read it. I just logged on through the web then, and the message was there, but if you could fix it in the app, that'd be great. Using the Message Center to get a billing issue resolved was amazing!",Bturbo911,2013-08-05 14:30:58,,,
Fantastic,5,False,"Hands down the best health app on the market. From the ability to access records on the phone, tablet and even Apple Watch, to the cool new feature Daily on the phone I continue to be impressed with the Mayo Clinic app.

Keep up the good work!",Watchalookinatbub,2016-05-10 01:20:06,,,
Very informative and helpful for scheduling appointments,5,False,"A very good app. It is very easy to add your appointments to your calendar and bundle appointments so you don't have to keep traveling to Mayo.

Articles in the daily section are also very helpful.",Vincent V,2017-05-10 20:27:54,,,

"Good, but a work in progress.",3,False,"For as astoundingly good at medicine as Mayo is, this app needs more support.  Several pages open and tell you they will be supported or filled in or activated at some point in the future.  Would be nice for those features to work now.

The functions that are live work very well. Appointment calendar, reminders, facility maps, all excellent.  Communication with providers  needs some improvement.",DucFanDan,2014-12-08 08:01:53,,,

Thank you Mayo clinic!!,KellyPatient,2013-07-18 02:07:40,,,
Simply fantastic,5,False,"The team knocked it out of the park with this.  Medical records access, charted biometric lab results, appointment itinerary implementation..  So much utility here.  I don't know if anybody else in the medical world
Is ahead of this, but I'm betting this app raises the bar for secure access to patient medical data, and making the data useful and actionable!

If you are a patient or a caregiver at mayo - you definitely should have this.  

Looking forward to future improvements like being able to opt out of snail mailed paper itineraries getting mailed x-country.

Self-promoting news channel,1,False,"This isn't really an app that allows you to benefit from it or be entertained or even educated by it. It's a blog/ezine/promo tool for the already puffed up Mayo Clinic. When I requested an appointment, about all that you CAN do with this app, they said that I wasn't ""appropriate"" for them to treat. Not sure what they meant by that: I'm not rich, famous, connected, or hopelessly sick enough?! They should double-check their organizational alignment with the Hippocratic oath.

The bar is set for American healthcare,5,False,"Having been in other medical programs and longing to experience the Mayo system, I finally had my chance to receive 2 full days of treatment. During the very first appointment I was introduced to this app - and the bar was set. I could ditch my literal 1/2"" thick stack of papers and forms that I had grown accustomed to traveling with while in any hospital. 

This app is as amazing as the staff and system at the Mayo clinic. It only makes sense that I should be able to see the same medical results that my doctors can see, I can read their write-ups after my  visits, and do my own research using their in-app library of papers, news and videos. 

Logistically, this app is better than Apple maps as it keeps your list of appointments organized and as up to date as the registration desk you just left. All while remaining synced with your calendar.  I had a few appointments that needed rescheduling/flipping with others and as soon as the registration desk was done making the change, I could look up the new information on this app, get the map to the appointment location, and all the patient prep documents at my fingertips. Talk about making the patient part of the care team!

I feel like this is the new standard for healthcare. Mayo's approach of treating the patient experience as ""the only experience"" can be felt during your interactions with the staff and as you interact with this app. I only hope the rest of the American healthcare system is watching and learning how the healthcare system should work.",trial user 12345,2013-06-01 12:56:02,,,

OK but could be better,3,False,"I've used both the app and the online portal extensively and while both were ahead of their time initially, in today's world when most provider's provide a portal to patient information, I find Mayo's portal is becoming antiquated.

Overall, you can do more using the online portal, but the app is more user friendly when it works. It can be glitchy and if this occurs, deleting and reinstalling the app may improve glitch issues.

Things I'd like to see improved with both:

A patient note section that patients can use to create their own notes. Having someplace central where patients can keep information  relevant to their appointments or care, would allow us to have one central repository for all our information. Currently I use Evernote for my notes, so jumping back and forth between the 2 is cumbersome.

The messaging utility is lacking. For people who have periodic physicals at Mayo's it's frustrating. Any contacts from one physical are removed and replaced when another physical occurs, yet many of those earlier providers are still relevant and should be left accessible to patients.

Executive Physicals manipulates the contact information in a sort of heavy handed manner. Rather than providing patients with access to all their care givers, the Executive team doesn't want patients to communicate directly with their main provider. They route all communications through them which adds days onto any communications...not a great scenario when timely information is important.  

This one aspect alone impairs the whole Executive physical so much that I think it negates the positive concierge aspects of this service. In the end, patients medical needs are primary and the Executive Physicals program needs to rethink how they restrict patients' access to their providers...especially in light of the increased costs involved in using this service versus the more traditional one for physicals.

Patient access to their medical information is quick and generally good, but there are a few problems. The most notable being that things like final reports for longer stays and physicals should be available via the portal. These reports are usually mailed or sent by email and should be included with all the other reports. 

Finding medical information with the app or the portal is unnecessarily complex. I don't know how it can be fixed...but it needs to be. Random reports that don't seem to fall into other categories sometimes show up under the Continuity of Care section. Reports from older visits are oftentimes removed when newer visits occur...but these old reports are still important. 

Most patients coming to Mayo's have greater medical needs or more complex issues than your average patient. Mayo's isn't usually their primary care provider either, so they rely more heavily upon the reports which their primary care givers need. This function currently has bottlenecks ranging from:

- reports just never being available like full follow up summaries
- reports being removed when new visits occur
- some really old reports like medications lists are stuck in there and even though newer ones have been supplied and may be found somewhere else...the old ones just confuse both providers and patients.
- there should be better ways for patients to export data in the reports. While exporting a complete report is possible...sometimes just a portion of it is needed. I use the Print - to PDF method on ios to extract this information...but most people don't know how to do this and there should be simpler methods.

Lab results are exemplary in that they include historic results and provide graphs when appropriate. This is a good example of reporting at it's best. 

When I was there I found the app didn't always provide me with the most current appointment schedule, so I ended up relying on the paper schedules that other reviewers have mentioned too.

Overall the app and portal are OK. They once set the gold standard for patient's access to medical information but today both seem like they need at a minimum to be brought up to current standards. 

Better yet would be to improve these aspects to keep pace with the world renowned medical reputation Mayo's continues to garner.",vsatips,2017-03-29 18:45:44,,,

Needs Messaging Notifications and Other Issues,1,False,"I like using the app to communicate with my providers, but a push notification of new messages would be EXTREMELY helpful.

It is NOT useful that your current appointment disappears from your schedule after the time of the appointment, since you're often called in late. So if you are running late, there is no way to see when your appt was scheduled, to see how late you're running. 

It also makes no sense that if you check in with a live person, they will tell you which door you will be called from, but if you use the kiosk or e-check-in, it won't tell you this information. 

Overall, I expect better from Mayo Clinic.

Frustrating app - auto logout too fast,2,False,"I wish they would focus more effort on the patient interface than the generic content. 

I wanted to scream after preparing the bulk of a perfectly-worded email to my MD, but before I could finish up the program auto logged me off without warning and without saving a draft. Arghhh.

Worse even for those disabled or elderly.

Until they fix this - Make sure you write up your emails and appt requests in advance in another program to cut and paste or you risk getting automatically logged out and losing all your data.  

Other cons:

No feature to check pending requests.

I like the fact I can easily download and/or forward data - to hometown care providers.  When I compare this to my local healthcare provider (Affinity Healthcare)... there is no comparison.  Mayo should market the code to this to local providers.  I don't use our local providers portal because it is worthless.
