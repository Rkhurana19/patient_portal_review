Nice features but the interface could use some work,False,3,donhessman,"Being able to communicate directly with my doctor through the app has been a game changer. Being able to see my medical records on the app is amazing!

Here are a couple of suggestions though. The messaging feature is a little clunky. Unless I access it from the records section of the app, it won’t let me reply to messages. Even worse, you have to start over each time on selecting your provider/facility, then your doctor. Can we please get the ability to just have that information saved and pre-populated when writing messages until we change it? Additionally, it would be really great to be able to share file attachments like images or PDFs. 

Lastly, I love the feature where you can share Fitbit data with your doctor. Will we one day be able to also share Apple Health data? It would be great to able to give my doctor access to data from my Apple Watch.",2020-01-26 02:02:56
Think app needs an update bc of iOS 15,False,2,Pennybink,"Can login but initially it was not being able to make an appointment and view records. Didn’t try sending message via the app as I had no reason to do so. Eventually was able to make an appointment. But still trouble login to view records pops up. Deleting app and all you should do with an app not responding as it should has not helped. Update: been reading other reviews. I had a drive through Covid test and because of that, I was in the medical clinics system with Healow being available that I didn’t know at the time. Later after seeing that place used Healow, I was able to use my phone number with some information to get in via a web browser on my computer. Can’t recall if I input a password in account there, suspect I did. But do know I did not know my user name from the browser computer version. So the app. Frustrating to get in. Think I clicked forgot password but do know that I was allowed to use my phone to login and from there saw my user name. No idea if others use FirstnameLastnameBirthyear for user name. I wish I could recall when the password was made, likely it was browser version. Capital first letter of first name and Capital first letter of last name then 19- - birth year and no spaces. This worked for my husband too.",2021-10-05 16:15:45
Zero Confidence in Healow,False,1,PJJJK in MA,"My health care provider swapped from Follow My Health to Healow. Prior to the change I was not too fond of Follow My Health. Since the transition I can honestly say that in my personal experience Follow My Health is a Rock Star when compared to Healow. I can only assume the “low” in Healow stands for low bidder.
      I initially gave up after multiple attempts to set up a Healo account to access my personal medical records. Recently (many months later) I made another attempt which proved just as frustrating and unsuccessful. Eventually support was received from my Medical Providers staff. Healow support is in my experience non-existent. 
       As to the Healow app’s content and ease of use. My experience thus far warrants Zero Stars ! I suspect Healow is in the profit business and not the medical records business. This patient’s experience allows Healow’s site was definitely not created from a patient’s perspective or needs. Their site does not even recognize my Primary Care Provider or The Medical Practice they service after requesting just that info !
     With no intention to create a negative this has thus far been my personal experience. Hopefully one that Healow will consider to improve their service. If and when they were to make improvements I will post a retraction with a better score. Till then 
I hope your experience is better than mine.",2022-01-18 20:25:05
Nonfunctional app,False,1,TheWallaby,"Wasted 2 hours trying to set up this app the night before an appointment.  Issue is I already had Healow installed in prep for a different appointment.  Process went fairly smoothly to log into the portal the first time but that appointment is days away.  I have an appointment tomorrow with another provider who unfortunately also requires Healow.  App is already installed and NOTHING works to add a new account from the app (using iPhone 11)...finds provider but subsequent prompts just will not accept input.  Bailed out and logged in from my newer laptop only to watch it reject every browser I tried (Chrome, IE, Edge) as “unsupported.”   Ended up giving up and logging on using the browser app from my iPhone, bypasses the app entirely. At least the test didn’t reject the browser, but it’s really not optimized for the main bike screen.  Due to COVID risk,I need these virtual visits. Guess if it doesn’t work tomorrow with my crazy workaround I’ll cancel my appointment and blame it on eClinicalWorks.  I know I won’t be the first to do so. As an IT professional in healthcare, I hate seeing buggy apps like these because I know it will be a barrier to healthcare for some non technical or older people. Sad.

Update:  assuming eCW took the backend down last evening with NO alert that maintenance was occurring.  Monday am functions like linking an account mysteriously work.  Wow.  What a waste of an evening.",2020-04-27 13:25:46
Frustratingly bad design,False,1,Real-Pro,"Like so many things in the American health care system, this app is a sprawling poorly organized mess, needlessly difficult to navigate and ultimately-give-up frustrating. Your incoming messages are on the landing page but how do you get to the thread of received AND sent? Not from there! And not by clicking on Messages either. No, you have to stumble on My Records and discover them buried there for some reason. Want to renew a prescription? You can do it if you know the secret (as in completely unlabeled) button 5 clicks deep from the main menu. Need to tell the app which pharmacy to use? Hope it’s not CVS because you will have to manually search through the list of EVERY CVS in the US, randomly listed, screen by screen, until you find your needle in the haystack. And don’t bother seeking advice on how to do this more efficiently: searching Help for the word “pharmacy” yields exactly zero results. Why would anyone make these boneheaded basic usability decisions? This app is like punishment for actually trying to perform basic healthcare functions online, as if your provider were yelling at you, “just pick up the phone, for God’s sake!”",2021-04-12 12:02:21
I can’t rate it any better,False,1,flowerlily1,"This app is extremely frustrating. I have not been able to log in since December. My Doctor’s office has reset it several times to no avail. I keep trying to retrieve/ reset my user name/password only to be told I am not registered. I have received ONE email from support and even though I explained the above and requested a phone call more than a week ago, nobody has replied. Right now my opinion of this app is that plus garbage and customer service none existent. 

Follow up: today I received an email notifying me that they are considering my case closed. Has anyone bothered to contact 
Me by phone (as I requested) or even by email?  NO! and they are closing my case??? Unfortunately I can’t give them any lower than a one star. This rating does not necessarily speak for the app. For all I know it’s a great app BUT I have not been able to use it so I can’t say. My issue is mainly with customer service.
I wonder, do they just have bad service? Incompetent reps? Or are they just so inundated with complaints that they have missed my request?  In any case, this app is useless to me as it stands.",2022-03-31 15:49:26
New to Dr Smart... app is an awesome 1st step,False,5,27thLetter,"After the worst transition from a great physician for over 2 years , to what I would say was beyond INSULTING new estab appt w/a PA yesterday, that was time wasted. The PA 1st stating a well known ADD med “didn’t exist,”then she “can’t find my history w/ this rx that I’ve been on for 1.5yrs...ergo, not going to refill or even reduce milligram, if THAT were the true reason she denied to write for 1 refill of an rx taken daily. She refused an antibiotic for severe sinus infection, stating “insurance won’t cover “, yet I have filled it in past w/out a problem? I left after 2 hours, w/ no progress & no refills. An antidepressant & ADD med taken daily that I’ll be out of next week, leaving me lost.I changed immediately to a Dr linked with app, if they care for patients as well as app assists, I will rest easy. It seems they do, we shall see. I have a great feeling about the Drs I will be linked to. Thank you for a great app.",2019-03-08 18:56:28
Works but needs work,False,3,teeblackley,"Though I installed this app a couple years ago, I haven’t needed to really use it until recently. How do I delete or even archive “we miss you” or “happy holidays” messages? Messages need the option to maintain their thread like in every other messaging app. 

I like having a history of my lab and test results and have been able to rely on this feature and is what has kept me using it.  

One of my main concerns is readability. The fonts are small, thin and lightweight which makes them difficult to read. I could rely more on the icons (appointments, records, etc) on the main screen if they’re easier to see (small, faint, and detailed). Ironically they are easier to see on the Help screen! The readability issue applies to every screen. 

Sadly, I think this app must be one of the lower priced among the options for medical professionals. The version history reflects a lot of bug response, but the last enhancement was 8 months ago and the last update 2 years ago. 

The in-app “report a problem” is non-functioning. I question whether the development team even follows reviews/suggestions for improvement or actively works to improve this app. It works, but comes in juuuust under the wire.",2020-10-01 12:42:23
No place in medicine,False,1,Zumba*chic,It’s very simple really. Apps have no place in medicine. This is our health we are talking about for which we must rely on yet another device. If something is done such as bloodwork or other tests we should receive a call. My glucose was out of range and rather than call me I had to download this silly app and Google what this might mean. I was told it wasn’t alarming because I had not fasted. I wanted to say I have not once in my life been out of range and had only ever once had a fasting glucose test. This is a huge fail on the part of healthcare. Impersonal and difficult for older generations. They will miss things. They will confuse people. Dr.’s hate it when the general public googles diagnosis and possible health concern scenarios yet they continue to alienate patients. This is just a new way to hold us at arms length. Few people know how to read cbc/chem analysis values and an entire generation struggles with the tech. We don’t need this. We need healthcare workers to do what they do best and communicate with us. Big thumbs down,2022-04-18 14:06:38
Don’t understand what most of you have Against security measures,False,5,SurvivorKym,"I for one like the added measures. If you’ve ever had your identity stolen and your medical information and insurance used and then have to fight for years to clean it up you should be happy that they’re taking these extra subs to protect you so one extra strap may be frustrating but in the long run it could be saving you 1 million other stops. Love the doctors love the app and the security. With having stage four bone cancer that is now going to the brain barrier my left orbital socket and plate the extra measures are good for me and I take them every time because I am not having my identity insurance and all of that stolen again so I praise the app, five stars I’d give it 10 if I could",2022-01-05 11:51:45
Good but messaging needs improvement,False,4,GP-1970,"This App is a well done application that provides good medical record keeping and communication between patient and doctors. 

The one issue that is a problem for this application is the messaging. When constructing a message addressed to a doctor, many times an error appears when attempting to send a message, “only valid characters are allowed (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), including all special characters“. Yet the message does not include any invalid characters or even special characters beyond “)” and “(“ according to the error message.

To work around this error, I have to construct my message in the IOS “note” app and then copy/paste the message to the Healow app. This is very inconvenient. But I still use this application to communicate with my doctors.",2022-04-11 16:37:37
App is not accessible to blind users,False,1,labishop123,"I rely on voiceover, a screen reader on Apple iPhones to use my phone and apps that I download onto it. Furthermore, I rely on my doctors health applications so that I can independently review my health information and make informed decisions in my healthcare. With this app, I am having problems accessing my Health information, the app refreshes while I am trying to navigate using voice over gestures, and I cannot utilize the messaging feature. In many situations, it has taken me over 30 or 45 minutes to read important information such as my lab results and vitals. It should normally take about 10 or so minutes to do this. I respectfully ask that you make the changes necessary for this application to be compatible with voiceover, as this electronic application is one of the only ways that blind people can independently access their health records. 
I thank you for your time and consideration reading this review.",2022-03-24 13:42:32
Needs improvement.,False,3,MMMM1011,"I do like the app,but there are improvement that need to be made. For example one of the my most used feature is the messaging. Most of the time it’s easier than making a phone call however I can’t see the message until 2 hours after it was sent even if I check the app constantly. If my doctor sent me a message at 3 o’clock I won’t be in my inbox until 5 which is a frustrating inconvenience. It would also be helpful if I could get a notification when I get a message as well.  The telahealth visit through the app is hit or miss and my doctor and I often have to do it another way. If the developers take one thing from this review to fix please fix the messaging lag.",2020-07-30 21:50:25
Useless!,False,1,BallisticsGirl,"I use this app for my neurologist. Out of all the specialist I see, it’s one of the two most important! I haven’t been able to get an email response from my doctor’s office since 2017 via the app! 
What you see on the app:
- Some of your records. 
    -you cannot open your lab results, or anything like that though. 
- Maybe half of your medications that you take from other doctors. 
- Appointments (this feature I’ve never had trouble with). 
- As I mentioned that it’s been two years since I’ve received an email from my doctors office via the app or even to my personal email... I can’t tell if the office is even getting the emails from the program, or if the new MAs are even aware of the program! (This makes me miss the people that left office.) Or to be honest if my doctor is even aware of the program! 
My pharmacy gets notes from my doctor to give to me about seeing him immediately, yet his front desk balks at that notion, so when I try to contact my doctor via the app to let him know... there’s always radio silence. 

Then to make things worse, you cannot reply to an email thread. It has to be a new email. Therefore, no one can keep track of vital information such as seizures or anything of the like! 

I wish my office would switch to a more efficient program, or that Healow would fix their glitches for the sake of doctors and patients alike.",2019-08-19 15:11:49
It’s a useful app when it wants to work,False,2,garbagesquid,"I like being able to connect to my doctor without needing to cal and monitor my lab results and medications on here but the app itself is extremely buggy. Right now I can’t even log in using my pin, it’ll take me to the Home Screen and then immediately back to the pin Lock Screen. After entering my pin again, it’ll tell me an error has occurred. 

Not only that but messages never load properly, and you cant reply outright to any messages, you have to go in and create a brand new message to send out. The hit points of each button aren’t properly placed so you have to make sure you hit dead center (sometimes not even dead center) in order to click on certain names or access files. This is lack of basic design knowledge. 

Overall the functionality and the UI design of this app fails in a lot of ways and I feel the only reason why this app even still exists is because it’s a necessity for patients like me to use. That’s not a good business practice at all. You’re doing less than the bare minimum of whats required to have a functional app. Whatever bugs you may have fixed generally end up causing more problems. 

Please hire a team that knows how to integrate functionality into design.",2021-09-23 17:00:48
Heading in right direction,False,4,aprilpatt,"This app has a lot of excellent features, and I especially appreciate the efficiency of communication it allows between me and my children’s pediatrician. I have been using this app for several years now, and the main thing I‘d ask you to improve is the messaging. Parents/patients need the ability to reply, and to also see the original sent message. It’s really frustrating to have to completely start over a message each time a response is needed, and to not even be able to refer back to the original/other follow-up messages. ... Other than that, the app’s features are really great. Love the access to all records, lab reports, health logs, visit summaries, etc. UX is intuitive and simple.",2020-07-06 13:33:56
Messaging system is awful,False,1,Tuireann,"The app in general feels clunky to use. But the main issue I have is that the messaging system is difficult to keep track of. As far as I can tell, there's no way to see messages you've sent to your providers. Similarly, you cannot reply to messages you receive from your providers. The end result is that I can never remind myself what I've already sent to my provider and when, and in every new message response to my providers I have to explicitly reference the context that I'm messaging them about.

Simply adding an outbox, and the ability to reply and create essentially ""email threads"" would massively improve this glaring issue. This style of messaging has been around for ages because it works well for most cases. It'd not groundbreaking. That it's not already a basic feature of the application despite it being the year 2022 is absolutely baffling.",2022-04-26 16:08:21
Poor interface,False,1,MidCityJB,"Dealing with medical appointments and test results can be stressful. The Healow app test results section looks like someone typed it on an old-school keyboard. Unless you are very familiar with medical terms, it is not intuitive. Other major providers in my city use the MyChart app where in contrast the user interface is a breeze to navigate and visually appealing test results which makes it easy to understand your results. i.e. easy to understand if there is reason to be concerned. The Healow app is slow to respond whether you are on Wi-Fi or the network. When you get notifications via email, the information isn’t in the message on the app. It often says “oops”. Sad that a wealthy institution like Tulane University in New Orleans would use such a poor application. When I expressed my frustration with navigation within the app, staff at the clinic laughed and said “no one uses that app, just email us.”",2021-03-03 03:39:56
"The best app, for the very best Doctor.",False,5,LoganRexLoveless,"I’ve seen my doctor going on over 10 year. 
 The problems I have were so huge that it would overwhelm most doctors, not this doctor. He saved my life and I’ll always be happy and respect him, not only him as as a person, but I’ll always trust and respect his treatment and medication plans. Not only has the treatment he has given me works l, but I’m no longer the sick and dying person that I was going to be. This app shows all the meds I’m on, it shows so many things that makes me feel like my doctor is always an app away. So thank you, Healow, for letting me write this to show just a little of how I feel about my doctor and this app. 
   
   Thanks Again,

"Good idea, poor execution",False,1,Zvi Aranoff,"I have this app on my phone because it’s used by my daughter’s pediatricians office. In theory, I could see on it appointments, medical information, communicate with the pediatrician, etc. In reality, however, I find this app to be completely useless. Either the problem is with the app itself, or with how it’s linked to my doctor’s website. Either way, messages don’t open up, I don’t see appointments, I can get records, etc. Basically, it doesn’t do anything it purports to do. For example, I can see on the app that my doctor replied to me, but the messages don’t open up. Or they take so long to open, that I get frustrated and just log on directly to my doctor’s website and read it there. As a result, I don’t actually use this app. I check it once in a while, to see if anything changed after an update, but I end up resorting directly to the doctor’s website.",2018-02-08 12:41:23
Great concept but hard to use and sometimes dysfunctional,False,3,StealthyKhajiit,"I rely on this app to communicate with my doctors quick and effectively and it’s really nice, although sometimes I won’t be able to read emails from my doctor, as it cuts them off and the message won’t expand. When that happens I have to try to copy it and paste it in my notes app to read it. 
Also, when you try to compose a message and you back out of it, it completely deletes everything and you have to start over. A drafts option would be nice. I do really think that this app could become better with some work and it has potential, but for now I’ll deal with the bugs and irritable occurrences since I need the app lol",2021-02-03 02:06:35
No Apple Health Intergration,False,1,Mattl121212,"Really think this app needs to interface with Apple Health.  The nature of this app is a digital link to one’s medical providers.  Why not connect with iOS’s central repository of health information?  No better way to share health data measured outside the office with one’s doctor, and to push vitals from official medical appointments / tests back to Apple Health.  IMO this needs to be integrated to be a great iOS app.

Less critical, but I would also challenge the dev team to find creative ways to encourage medical offices to use the full features of the Healow system; mainly the entering of vitals and test results into the system.  My PC doctors office seems to only use Healow for appointments as of now, and I have a feeling others are doing the same.  Suggestion above of sharing data with med office from Apple Health may encourage them to do the same on their end.",2021-02-11 14:41:36
Worthless,False,1,7arheel88,"This app is a waste of time and effort. I can access my information by logging directly into the Healow website, but the app has no data. I can log into the app, but there is nothing there... no appointments, no lab results, no messages, nothing. I can see all of this information on the web so I know it should be there. Support has been unhelpful. They send emails apologizing and asking me for details about my problem. I tell them the problem over and over and over again. Their only answer is to uninstall and reinstall, which I have done 3 times. Still, the same problem of no data in the app. Last email, they want me to ask my doctor’s office to open a case with them. What?  Are you kidding me?  If you can’t solve this problem with one support ticket, how does a second support ticket solve anything. Don’t waste your time. The app does not work",2019-04-24 00:26:25
Awesome app for those that live long distances from your Dr.,False,4,troyalee,"I have had pleasure of using the app since it’s inception. Just the ability to request prescription refills alone is Very accommodating. Having your clinical I.e, blood work results at you fingertip, doctors comments and suggestions on improving your healthy life imbalances. Doctor patient communication is enhanced allowing doctors to address patients current and possibly additional concerns or issues that he or she may get answers from dr on the portal. Access to : heath and prescription records, labs , schedule office visits, get referrals, etc...  I live 4.5 hours away.

Shocked how helpful it is!!,False,5,Supernatural witch,"I’ve only used this for about 3 mths. I have a TON of scripts due to nerve damage, high blood pressure and now liver issues because of the long term medications that I need. I never remember when I’ve made my next app & I always lose the cards. This has everything in one place. Finally!!! Plus my doctor’s office is able to answer day to day questions, refill non-narcotic medication and I am able to find out about past visits all together. I have a lot of health issues so I find this VERY helpful. If you are the same or have an elderly parent/family member this will make life so easy.

No point to have app,False,1,Joker Loco 562,Can’t communicate with the doctor. Can’t reschedule appointment can’t message or see anything. This app is pointless. The doctors office is now closed on fridays. Never notified of this can’t reschedule an appointment within 24 hours to avoid extra fees even though I’m trying 4 days in advance. Even the app can’t reschedule for you. The only thing you can see on this app is that you have an appointment scheduled. Any other things it claims to have as a feature it doesn’t. Even messages from the provider are blank. The developer of this app needs to lay off the drugs a bit to make a working app. Since the last time there was a issue they claimed to work on it. After the update all they did was delete more features. This is stupid. Lay off the crack ok. Get your head straight or just delete the app entirely.,2022-01-21 20:32:41
Absolutely awesome,False,5,Deafie_b,"I like having this option to tell my doctor something that is on my mind that I might forget by the time I go for my appointment. 
Sometimes it ends up looking like a chapter of a book, but it saves him time when I am there, bc he knows already and is prepared to take care of the problem. If I had not sent a message, I would be in the exam room longer, taking up some time that should be for another patient.
I did have a problem with not being able to send bc of commas, etc.  after telling the receptionist at the office she gave me a phone number and I called, got it taken care of and now have no problem.",2019-02-28 17:21:09
Great app,False,5,aflette,"I love Healow, I really do. It's a great app, but my only complaint is that when you're sending a message to your doctor/nurse or whoever, it doesn't allow you to use apostrophes. It says ""special characters like ' are not allowed."" Is there any way to fix this?? Because I type contractions more often than not without thinking and autocorrect fixes it too if you don't put it in, and separating out all the words or taking the apostrophes out is really annoying and takes more time than necessary. I know this is a minor thing but it's SUPER annoying.

Excellent portability if you have more than one physician,False,5,KS Flatlander,"I like having all my lab values available so I can just hand my phone to a new doctor to view any needed lab data directly.  Text messaging directly with doctor’s nurse has given me fast direct access you would never match with phone calls.  Appointments are easily verified by dates & times if you forget. In addition, appointment reminders can be sent to you as well.  Medication records are continuously available for your convenience and easy to update by you and your physician.  This is a concise, easy to use medical program everyone will appreciate.",2018-03-18 11:44:46
"Terrible app: Missing functionality, confusing UI, and little active development",False,1,PreppieTechie,The user interface is super weird and doesn’t follow any of the best practices for mobile user interfaces. The interface looks like something from the early 2000’s and is a confusing mess. My doctor doesn’t use half of the features (because the doctor’s interface is equally bizarre and confusing) so this app is little more than a messaging portal. Even my lab results show up as a message because the doctor’s office can’t figure out how to use this thing. Even basic features like Apple Health integration is missing. Need to share your Apple Watch ECG results? Nope. Want to share activity? Nope. Doc wants regular weight check ins? Nope. This app is a prime example of why our healthcare system is a mess. Health orgs are paying too dollar for this hot mess.,2021-12-02 03:07:53
App is not accessible for visually impaired users,False,1,Cindy19691984,"This has become the go to app for many of my healthcare providers. And because of that fact, this app needs to become ADA compliant. I am a visually impaired client and I use a screen reader, iOS VoiceOver, to navigate all apps. I cannot check my medical records, prescriptions, vital information or do anything with this app. I am also unable to share my medical records amongst my various providers. This is put me in a very precarious situation, healthwise. As previously mentioned, this is the go to app and my providers expect that I am able to provide them information using this app. It’s egregious that this app is not accessible. Also, the fact that I was emailed a response stating the fact that the app is not accessible, makes you liable. This app needs to be fixed. It needs to be made accessible.",2021-11-15 20:40:03
Lousy app,False,1,PwrTek,"My doctor’s office adopted this app. I downloaded it and went through the process of checking in for an upcoming appointment. As part of the checking process, I was asked to verify my current medications. If there were additional medications, there is a place to list them. I noted the additional medications I was taking and clicked to go to the next step. I got a message that indicated I had apparently included a character that was not acceptable. Instead of highlighting what the software did not like and giving me a chance to correct it, the software just wiped out all my input. I reentered the info using only alphabetic and numeric characters and spaces and the app did the same thing. It again erased all the info I entered, again with no explanation as to what the app found to be offensive. In today’s world this is pure garbage programing.",2020-11-05 00:55:29

Referring Dr Brown,False,5,Tink 1966,"I was in need of a new Doctor ASAP and found this group of doctors.  I had such nerves about having to find a new family doctor.  I came across the 
Houston Primary Care group and was extremely pleased with the staff in Byron.
I made an appointment and was seen that next day.  I am so pleased with the staff that I’ve worked with.  I was afraid to make the switch, but I am extremely impressed with Dr. Brown and his staff.  I was made to feel right at home, like I had been with them for years.  From the front desk to Henry in the back office.

Nice to have my information readily available,False,5,Nicknamedddddddddd,"I feel bad for the person who can’t get it to work. Maybe it has something to do with area of the country???
Anyway, it works for me. 
I have used many features. I can request an appointment or prescription refill. I can review my lab results. I can see upcoming appointments. That’s about all I need to do. 

I have not needed to attach a file to send to my dr, so I can’t help the frustrated person with that. Hopefully, the app designers will correct that unfortunate dilemma, because sending info documents to doctor is a necessary and usual task.",2018-12-02 12:51:34
Notifications don’t work,False,1,SmilingEyes222,"When I’m writing messages back and forth to my doctor over a period of a couple days, it would be nice if the notification feature actually worked. When new messages from my doctor come in, I am not notified in any way unless the app is actually open on my phone and I am looking at it. If I am just using my phone as normal, I do not get any badge, banner, or sound notifications indicating that I have a new message waiting in the app. So really how is that helpful to those of us who use this app regularly with our doctors’ offices? It is really a waste of time to have to keep re-opening the app to check for messages from my doctor (which load very slowly) when I should just be able to receive those push notifications like any other app that I use on a regular basis. Please improve this!",2018-12-03 16:31:26
Application seems to have never been tested,False,1,UNIXSV,"First and foremost how this application was allowed to be released when simple system testing of this application would show the many flaws it has. When the company says this is useable application on the iPad I would disagree. For one when initially logging in you cannot rotate the app so you can use a keyboard with it is as a normal event. It seems the company that produced this did not use the patients they were creating this for to help test it. Second when trying to make sure you can connect for a telemedicine visit there is no way to test, so you really can’t be sure if you will make your appointment. Third, were is the patient data, I sure can’t find mine? Medical practices should get their money back for all the help you get from this.",2020-12-01 21:03:37
App on my iPhone isn’t compatible with my Apple Watch?,False,1,If everyone cared,"I don’t know why the developer wouldn’t list the Apple Watch as a tracker option. Everyone downloading the app on here has an iPhone and I would imagine most also have the Apple Watch. I would like to track my health and share with the doctors but I don’t want to spend money for something else.

The message feature on here is a little frustrating, you can’t reply to your own messages which I’ve wanted to multiple times to clarify what I wrote. Would be really great if that was updated.

I also keep getting notifications of new messages in my inbox but there aren’t any there and when I click the notification it brings me to the home page of the app. Might just be a bug that will fixed in the next update.",2020-11-21 13:00:37
Not user friendly,False,1,The Mrs. Suttle,"For me the biggest and most frustrating issue in this app is it’s messaging feature. Besides the fact that you cannot use simple punctuation, like apostrophes, you also cannot reply to your doctors messages. You have to start a whole new message, there is no threading of conversation ability. With a special needs child we sometimes need to go back and forth about things. This helps avoid bringing him into the office where there are sick kids that could pass him germs. A simple cold has almost cost him his life in the past, as he cannot manage the mucus/congestion that comes with one. 
Seeing records is difficult at best. Tests results come in, eventually. But not always in a timely manner. 
Good luck with the app! I hope they make it better as it COULD be an invaluable resource. As of now, it’s just a pain.",2018-10-23 20:59:22

Also my wife has an upcoming appointment at McBride and they sent her a link to access the portal and that link gives the same error messages. We have tried this on two different windows laptops using chrome and Firefox and we have tried it on two different iPhones and one iPad. I have tried contacting the tech-support at Mcbride Hospital and they have no idea why it is not working and say it will be next week before they have an answer.

App Review,False,5,Billy Albornoz,"This app is absolutely terrific because of the ways that it works and because of all that it has access to. They should really look into making sure that the company that created this kind of app always keeps up to date with the ways that the medical field in general works, so that therefore, no matter if anything at all changes within the industry itself, then all doctors, regardless of the part of the medical field that they’re in will always be able to be up to date with everything as far in advance as possible.",2018-08-21 20:18:05
Amazing app.,False,5,Tripl3_M,"As someone who forgets appointments or lose those little cards they give you at the doctors. This is great! I can check in and also confirm my appointment. Doctors can even message you with updates. You can even see lab results and even see referrals. When you click off the app logs you out which for confidentiality is amazing! 

***One thing I have noticed recently is that my appointments don’t show so I have to call and make sure I have one. (Maybe the app developers can fix that!) Other than that I love this app.****",2022-02-16 18:20:16
Frustrating and useless,False,1,Minakelly,"So Apparently I wasn’t registered and unrecognized as a patient by this app even I just see my doctor the day before. So I tried to ask question, no way to do so, looking for a phone number to contact with human being nope. No option for that. Went to the app, hey! They do have it! Nope it’s not fictional. And still no human option. In the app keep asking me to put PIN number, I ask to send them to either my phone or email, nada! Yes I check my junk too. Checked the app if it up to date, yup it is. This is why I need to work with human, not generated FAQ. Tried to reset, There is no way to reset. it’s so frustrating and terrible. I need my test results that I can’t even get it unless call the Dr. Office that closed and busy most of the time. 🙄🙄",2022-04-15 09:28:41
Way too many issues,False,1,Disability Access Matters,"I just read a review that clearly pointed out a major problem—and it was written two years ago. Yet nothing has changed!

You cannot reply directly to provider messages through Healow online. It is IMPOSSIBLE. Error messages come up every single time. The error messages state you’ve used characters that are not allowed—when you have not. You have to copy/paste your provider’s message into a a separate/new message in order to respond. As someone with a brain injury this forces me to spend more time on a screen than I can manage and is a nightmare. It’s completely unacceptable! 

Moreover, Healow Mobile used to have a passcode just for the app itself. Now it demands I set a passcode for my entire device. I don’t wish to do that. It’s annoying and also unacceptable. You don’t get to dictate how I manage my entire device.

Why did you remove the app passcode? Not ok. 

Fix these issues. I cannot believe someone wrote you a clear assessment TWO YEARS ago and you’ve done nothing. 

That does not leave me confident in your managing my health data, at all. 

Handle these problems.",2022-02-13 09:13:28
Lazy Customer Support,False,1,xMidnightArrow,"Got my name legally changed after a divorce, my doctors office changed everything on their end no problem. The Healow app customer support REFUSES to change my name in their system and claims that it’s a glitch and there’s simply “no way” to change my name once my account was set up. They also couldn’t create me a new account and link it to my doctors portal once my account had already been linked. I went back and forth with the guy for weeks, and all he was willing to do was close the support ticket marking it as “resolved”. People change their names ALL the time, so much so that it’s in the FAQs for most online accounts and such. I just simply cannot believe that it was impossible to resolve this issue, it was just laziness.",2021-01-20 23:01:17
"Below Garbage, completely and utterly USELESS!",False,1,TomThousand,"Will not correctly parse a password and let you login, even when you go to the website and reset it, even when you reset from the app, even when you say your prayers.  No way to access mobile app, no way to get help, no way to do anything except waste time and become frustrated.

My cardiologist could document the change in my EKG (my blood pressure distinctly ‘rose’) after trying to make this piece of junk work and I have over 30 years in the computer science field.

Even if the Apple app rating system supported negative 64 bit ratings (that’s right, below zero stars), I still couldn’t rate this laughable excuse of software lowly enough.  It’s a complete joke.  Do NOT waste your time!!  You have better things to do!  Like use a pencil!",2019-02-09 11:19:23
ZERO stars,False,1,CarolSaysBuyIt,"How on earth does this app have more than 1 star? I can’t think of any app in the history of apps that has caused me more frustration since my doctor’s office started using it six years ago. I hate it EVERY SINGLE TIME I use it. It’s awkward, hard to search, information is hidden three and four tabs deep, there is no continuity between the mobile and desktop versions, it is the least intuitive app I have ever used. I just spent 30 minutes on the phone with my dr. office and together we still came up empty handed looking for an appointment summary. If you are in medicine and considering using this for your practice, PLEASE don’t. It’s not good for your patient’s blood pressure. It will also tie up your front desk staff rather than saving them time.",2021-08-16 14:36:12
App is clumsy and counter intuitive,False,1,JohnGuerriere,"I have used MyChart extensively for years with other providers and find it simple to use and extremely intuitive. MyChart feels like it was designed for the iOS device. This app is clunky and just seems like it’s trying to be forced into  mobile experience. 

Other things are annoying and indicate the developers are behind the curve, such as asking me if I wanna use touch ID when new devices use face ID. As the parent of a minor it’s really difficult to understand how I create an account for minor and how I access a managed account of a minor.  

Suggestion would be just watch people use the app. From initial sign up all the way through..  Spend a day doing that document everything.",2021-01-19 12:59:23

I can not hold a cell phone, I drop or break them.  My iPad is stationary.  I installed this twice.  This app violates the Americans with Disabilities act by supplying video and mic services only to services some mobility disabled persons can not use as I can not.  My video and mic work with other apps and I have tele visits with other doctors.  But my primary care used this app which performance I would never recommend.  When I used the support help, the computer operated response ignored everything I reported and responded as if no concern was necessary.  Poor app function.

And also now it won’t show my doctor or next appointment, I try to add the doctor again and it’s not easy ( that’s another problem adding your doctor)so now I have to call them to get my appointment. This app is screwy. Update : So I just found where they keep your appointments and it’s still not listed , and I have an appointment this month.

New Version Erased my Login Info,False,4,prcrlc,"I like the program but it's only as good as its implementation by the medical practice. They determine what gets posted and the amount of detail. 

I'm using different apps for different hospitals and doctors. It's frustrating that I can't share information between them. I often find that specialists forget to send results to my primary care doctor. 

I'm not crazy about how email is implemented. I'd like to be able to send a message to my MDs assistant without having to type in a long subject line to made sure it's routed to the right person. I'd also like folders for messages.",2017-06-22 23:13:05

Then thought I would put it on my phone as I do have a passcode on my phone.  Healow would NOT let me access the app unless I gave them access to my audio and visuals.  I will not allow them to take over my phone, therefore I have deleted them from my phone and if they continue to refuse me access on my iPad I will delete them from there also.

I even tried to check message, none about statement.  So I still had to go to the website anyway.  Why bother with going to the app in the first place?  I do find that the app is informative on getting test results and in communicating with the dr’s office.  Which is why this is a “3”rating vs “1”.",2022-04-29 19:45:08

Useless Fecal Matter,False,1,YourNameHereX_________,"Last week blood was drawn at Tidelands Waccamaw Family Medicine (Pawleys Island, SC) per Dr Schwartz. No Trace of this test is in the app. 
Also, no matter what search I do within the app, the answer comes back with ""No results"", no matter how mundane the question (and believe me, I dumbed down the questions to the point that it was impossible not to return an answer). I find this app to be useless, and a complete waste of my time, as well as a HUGE waste of money for Tidelands Health. How about Tidelands not buying into crappy, useless apps, and lowering the price of healthcare?
Also, I can't believe someone gave this app 5-stars because they were happy with the office staff at a particular location. How can anyone leave a review for a piece of software that has ZERO to do with the app itself.",2018-02-11 15:47:02
Not reliable,False,1,Josiah Sprague,"I'd expect an app that people rely on for their health to have a higher standard of quality control and usability. I'd suggest that the team building this app invest time in increasing automated testing coverage, relax deadlines and pressure to release new features, and focus on paying off technical debt and refining usability and reliability of existing features for the next six months to a year. People use this app because their doctors ask them too, not because of shiny new features. To market this app to doctors, focus on the ease of use for patients to communicate with their doctors. At this point, I'd rather call my doctor than use this app. And I'm a tech savvy user.

If this is intended for more than one practice maybe using this - This should be set up  where instead of. Kids nance showing , it should show practice name .. after clicking on practice name .. show which  patients for that practice ...

Both the APP and the portal shows all previous and current Rxs  but does not differential between historical or current.   

One of my physician change clinical service even though I can unlink the office I cannot delete from the APP.   This might be confusing to a third party using my device at time of illness as the information on the unlinked physician is old and outdated and might result in a medical error.

Why do I need to be reminded of a schedule from the past- it certainly doesn’t necessitate an email to tell me to log in for important information.

Don't Delete Me Bro,False,1,Omeomyky50,"At first I loved this app but after while the app wouldn't pull up or access my records. The app then updated for ""bug fixes"" and I had to register all over again....and so trying to log in has become a flipping nightmare. It won't allow me to log in, nor my credentials, and promptly tells me that the account I've attempted to access is not me!!!! That it is in use!!! No duh! For goodness sake, I just want to access my records. I'm deleting the app and will request paper records. I don't like non-functioning apps. Is it because in January of this year I've gotten a new iPhone 7+ I requested to change my password and received an email; password was successfully changed. I truly do not understand it!",2017-06-07 14:33:16
Not functional,False,1,Frustrated pinner!,I was unable to find the medical practice that I had been to that requires me use this poor app so I couldn’t even finish patient portal registration. Then when I tried to troubleshoot shoot the app was so glitchy I couldn’t submit a help request because the “state” tab wouldn’t load. Without the state picked I couldn’t submit a help request. I need my test results tomorrow and am unable to register to get them. At this point I’m going to have to go back to the clinic to see if they will release my results to me on the spot. Hope I don’t have Covid because I’ve just been walking around sharing it with the world for the last three days if I do!,2022-03-06 09:51:53
Horrible App and Leads to Harassment,False,1,DitzyMaggie,"I HATE this app. I first downloaded it while I was pregnant because my first OB used it. That OB was awful and I switched to another OB that doesn’t use this all. I only continue to have it because unfortunately, my child’s pediatrician uses it.

In the span of about 2 hours in one single day, I received an in app message, text message, email AND phone call from my former OB’s office telling me to schedule a visit. I felt so harassed and I know that it is because of this app because the wording was exactly the same in all the messages I got, which started with the in app message.

When I tried to delete my former OB from my account, I saw that I couldn’t because it was considered my “primary practice” since I started this app with them. I contacted customer service and I was instructed to uninstall and then reinstall the app. That fixed the issue but that is just so primitive. I shouldn’t have to delete everything and then start over again. 

I feel like switching my child’s pediatrician because of how annoying this app is.",2020-01-31 04:13:59
Awful,False,1,HollyQuin,"My app is up-to-date and has been reinstalled and is running on a brand new iPhone 12 mini with the current OS — every time I try to read a message  a 404 error and when I went to report the issue The support page came up with an invalid request page. I tried to go through the developer link and had similar issues, this infuriating and unacceptable and time when patients are relying on this app for important medical information during this pandemic. 
I’m a tech savvy person and very frustrated I can’t imagine how infuriating this is for more vulnerable and sick people just trying to get help and communication with their providers.",2020-12-14 17:16:18
Great application... but....,False,4,silent prepper,"The application works extremely well. And this has a potential of becoming great. What I believe will make this app great is the ability to read iPhone health data. It would be great if you can choose and select the data to be read by the app. For example: bp data, glucose data, heart rate data and last but not least exercise data. Not asking to keep track but to be able to read and make it available for the Dr to read. Also a hook to read other data like HealthVault.

App works for me,False,5,CratieMack,"This is a neat app that I wish all my doctors used. I have a list of my medications readily available. I can take notes on what to ask about or what he doctor tells me on each appointment made. It tracks my appointments and gives me test results at the click of a button. I don’t send messages through it and I haven’t explored the entire app, but for my simple record keeping purposes, I like it. It’s handy for other doctor visits or trips to the hospital too.",2019-02-06 19:47:15

Poor Support / Non Functional App,False,1,A-List Traveller,"Its so frustrating that there are countless healthcare portals out there and I have yet to see one that is worth anything.  If I produced software this bad, I would be out of a job.  Fresh install, couldnt validate the account.  Contacted support who likes to respond 24 hours after the request, and any followup responses.  Expect to waste at least a week and not likely get anywhere.  Their terms and conditions do not populate, their account validation flow (SMS messaging) failed more often than it worked.  Clearly there are plumbing problems with this app and the web services it accesses.  Huge disappointment, I have deleted it.",2021-04-09 03:40:39
Poor design for iPad; didn’t find my info,False,1,Tlee210,"I had high hopes based on the reviews found two problems immediately. I installed the app, found my provider’s office, selected my doctor and it showed no current appointments - I have one tomorrow. 

The app doesn’t respond by rotating the display when using an iPad in landscape mode. I have an iPad case with built-in keyboard to make it much easier to type longer documents, emails, messages, etc. Since the app doesn’t rotate the display to match the screen orientation, I have to read it sideways, use the on-screen keyboard, or continually reposition the keyboard/screen. 

I deleted the app.",2020-07-29 13:39:56
Not working,False,2,Geographical issue,"I've been having issues with the app since I've tried to use it for the last couple of weeks. When I first started using it almost two years ago I didn't have any issues, but recently it's been giving me problems where I'm unable to do open any of the shortcuts in it. I get a log in error when I click anything. I've tried closing the app,  logging in and out, and going as far as uninstalling the app, but nothing fixes this issue. 
The weird thing is that I was able to use the app as normal just a few hours ago. It has since stopped working again.",2019-12-12 15:11:57
App is a Joke,False,1,tanbam,"This app is marginally useful.  It can help keep track of appointments and medications, and it has the promise of being able to be a great means for communicating with your doctors, but it’s by far the worst app I’ve ever seen for actual communication.  Seriously, it’s 2018 and you can’t use apostrophes in the messaging section?  It isn’t much fun going back through all of your messages to proofread and find all of the examples of ""I’m"" and ""doesn’t"" and change all of them to ""I am"" and ""does not"".  And make a tablet version already; I’m sure that the company makes enough money from the doctors who subscribe to spend a bit of development time in making a decent app.",2018-12-10 17:19:38
Why bother?!,False,1,LindaFB,"What the heck is going on with any Hospital or Medical group that would try to get patients to use this app? And the app wants users to give it access to camera and microphone to do voice/video conferencing? Why? I just spent hours trying to submit a help request to figure out how to change my email address, because the one that’s being used is no longer viable. 

This thing led me in circles and when I couldn’t get a help request to come up, I filled out a lengthy review. After which, it disappeared when the cache didn’t go through. Arghhh!!!

And, another thing. What web/app design team decided on a tiny, dainty italic typeface, with no serifs and no contrast!? Clearly, they are all under 30, with perfect reading vision; unlike most medical patients, who are older and trying to read this on their phones. For some, this typeface would practically be invisible. It certainly wouldn’t pass approval by any eye physician. 

I won’t be using this app until these issues are addressed and fixed.",2020-03-18 14:34:01
System Doesn’t Work Well,False,1,Professor Climate Change,"I’ve had two telemedicine visits scheduled through the app and both had to be cancelled—because of the app. It’s poorly designed, then further hobbled by HIPPA.  It’s almost as if the app were designed by lawyers rather than by app developers.  

Further is doesn’t mesh well with health portals.  Providers are unable to override the system or bypass it when it doesn’t work. Lots of physician and staff time is wasted, and while I doubt they care, patient time is wasted too. 

Each time my telemedicine appointments were cancelled I had to go to the doctor’s office anyway-two days for each appointment.  No time savings here.",2021-06-28 21:52:16
Buggy,False,1,ddeanmason,"I like the app as a way to message my doctor, but QA on new releases is poor.  Somehow in the latest release the ability to compose messages to my doctor...the buttons are still there and you can click it but then it takes you to referrals or some nonsense and there is no way to compose a message. 

Also the healow website invites you to leave feedback, but when you click on the leave feedback button it takes you to search their help as opposed to actually leaving feedback...guess they aren’t really interested in the feedback...again an product QA issue....clearly a theme.",2020-08-05 20:25:08
Major conflict,False,1,GeeLaree,"I’ve successfully used Healow for years. I’ve recently added a new doctor to my care team. There is no option on my version of Healow, which was updated a few days ago, to add anew doctor. I can add family members, but not a new doctor. I left a message for the support team, but no response. The new doctor’s off was very generous with their time trying to help me, but they too had to give up.

Simple and Efficient,False,5,charbelfia,This App allows you to easily and efficiently communicate with your doctor and staff. I will sometimes send my doctor notes on some of the things I want to discuss with him prior to an appointment. That way he can prepare for my visit and I won’t forget any questions I had.

There’s no place for me to upload my previous records. The messaging system lists tons of irrelevant clinics. You have to click on the clinic and then select the provider. They should have it where you can search for the provider with out having to short through clinics from multiple states that don’t necessarily match names of the clinic I’m going to.

 To resolve this, they should easily have an upload area to add files to records or a place to message the provider before the appt.",2021-09-10 06:28:45
Simple interface changes would make a big difference,False,3,tbkvt,"Being able to track the “Results” over time is great, but “Vitals” only show the latest result, so it’s tough to track the values over time. While height doesn’t change, weight, and blood pressure can change drastically.

This also happens if I try to respond through the Healow site on a browser instead of the app. I guess I’ll have to call on Monday and leave a message for the nurse.

I know my password, I know my passcode, why don’t they give an option of “if you decide to login without your phones passcode and face recognition you have a higher risk and it’s all on you press ok if you agree” or something like that. Anyways disappointing.",2021-11-29 14:54:08

At first I thought it was my phone so I restarted it, then untistalled the app. NOPE, the labs are still not visible.

Somewhat Clunky and notifications are broken,False,1,TekJensen,"I got used to the counter-intuitive UI but that notifications from my doctor stopped appearing makes me angry. 

Notifications used to work well and when it stopped, I gave the developer feedback. The communication didn’t work well enough for me to understand whether they didn’t believe my report and blamed the failure on me or if they simply didn’t understand me. Whether they believe me or not, I do not get notified when my doctor lets me know of life altering news.

Not tested by humans,False,1,"cindys,om","This app is one of those really poorly thought out apps made by people who have never actually used the app themselves.

First, it insists that the device MUST have a passcode, even if it never leaves the house and is locked by other means.

Second, it gives absolutely NO information about what’s going wrong when it won’t let you proceed. For instance, when setting a password, they want uppercase, lowercase, a number, and a special character and must be between 8 and 64 characters. I can say with absolute certainty that I have all of this. However, I cannot continue.

Perhaps they have their own definition of “special character”. Do you think they’d share this with us? Do you think they’d tell us there’s an issue with the password entered? Heck, no.

As we all know these days we can do most if not all emails on a lower budget cellphone. And since I have experience in programs I will say even “Word Star” could handle all of the compositions it was thrown at it. Remember ‘‘tis program was the big boy on the block in the late 1980’s.

When I type a message it won’t allow me to use punctuation marks like ‘ so instead of saying where’s my documents I have to go in and edit the message to say where are my documents.

Do not even try,False,1,sadie13579,"This app and the whole Healow company is terrible. If you try to reset a password it will never work meaning you can’t access critical lab/test results let alone do anything else. The functionality in the app is completely trash (for example: “easy login” does absolutely nothing but leave repeating the same steps endlessly without ever working). If you try to contact them to assist, good luck, you would have a better chance reaching someone with a magic 8 ball.

BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY,False,1,Ms_Larue,"Doctors, using this software may create bad reviews for office. 

- VISIBILITY 
The lab results DOES NOT fit page, in order to view completely, you have to scroll side to side

- ACCESSIBILITY 
The option to submit feedback does not work. The sending button is still pending and it’s been an hour since I’ve selected “submit” to send feedback. 

- FUNCTIONALITY 

When I tried sending a message to my doctor, I kept receiving an error message for special characters “ preventing the message to be sent to my doctor. After I deleted ALL of the punctuations in the body of the message, it still didn’t work.

You also cant reply to your doctors. You have to compose a brand new email every time you message so it's so difficult to understand what we're talking about since you continually have to go back to previous emails.

I wish the app would be laid out a bit better especially if it comes to messages,... why would you have them it two places in the app??? 🤔 
“Main screen” and in “my records” or at least fix it so you could see the actual message.

Seriously Underdeveloped,False,1,Frgrhtbrch,This app is a mess as is the website that led to it. Neither one functions as it should. The app doesn’t ask for a phone number but assigns a random one in order to attempt an impossible verification. The website has buttons that do nothing. How is that even possible in this day and age? The development director should be fired or given a much larger budget. Maybe then this experience wouldn’t be garbage and I wouldn’t have to wait two hours for a call back in order to make a doctor’s appointment. Garbage. Do better!

Not User Friendly,False,1,Designer-Zen,"The only thing this app did for me was allow me to reset my password, because I was unable to do so on the web site. However, I did not take it a step further as it is completely unnecessary to give absolute control of the camera and microphone to the developer in order to set up the account. All I need is to send / receive messages with my Doctor (which I read one review you can’t do on this app), review my history, and set up appointments. Why do you need to control my camera and microphone without my choice for this?!",2020-10-17 17:12:57
Pathetic app that degrades communication & raises your BP,False,1,KoolThinkin,"My primary physician uses this pathetic app for me to communicate to their office. These are some of its features:

1. If you go to another document to copy text to paste into it, it will require another fingerprint or password, even 15 seconds.
2. If you filled in a document to send, and are almost through, and have to answer a phone for a few minutes, it decides on its own to delete your document.
3. It doesn’t allow embedded hyperlinks that are so useful when sendind a PubMed article.
4. If you simply put the hyperlinks as straight text, it fpdoesn’t seem to allow, and shows a popup message about invalid characters used, but doesn’t highlight them, or explain exactly which charcters can’t be used.

This app is an example of a poorly executed product. Now I have to calm down, and mail a letter to my doctor. At lest my laser printer printer will accept all the characters I wish to use.",2020-01-31 02:17:24

Deleted immediately after getting my test results,False,1,tatsianafisiuk,"Horrible experience! Main concerns:
1. There are No website in the email with results. I Have to install the app to check my results. I deleted it immediately after that
2. App doesn’t want to work without me giving an access to camera and microphone. Really??
3. Automatic email, that says that I can check my result even doesn’t say what is the app I need to install. Highly annoying if I work with the laptop.
4. Millions of step to register
5. Complicated UI. When open an app there are no notifications. Where can I find my results!?

Summary: I spent about 5 min to pass the shock that clinic forces me to install an app. 20+ minutes to walk through the registration steps. 5+ minutes to walk around the app to eventually find my results.

30+ minutes to get result and A moment to delete the app after that.",2020-10-29 20:31:34

Horrible,False,1,WallyPS,"I am use to using MyChart / Epic. 

This app does NOT allow me to upload a photo to the doctor. 

If you reply to the doctor, the app can’t figure out that you need it be sent to the author of the email. You have to select the doctor, and facility each time.

Composing emails to the doctor don’t allow you to quote previous message texts, and is formatted horribly.

No push notifications when a RX has been sent to the pharmacy.

No push notifications when new lab results are received by the doctor.

Doesn’t allow you to manage other users (think elderly parents or children) on their app. You have to go to the web browser which of course uses all different URL’s for each provider.

I just wish the doctor would dump this app and go with something that is more robust and functional.",2022-03-16 01:41:04
Everything is suddenly gone,False,1,Myjackrulz,All my doctors offices are gone and I had to start like I was brand new. It can’t find all my doctors and I can’t stand having a passcode to get in. It made me set up a passcode and I can’t turn it off. My only other option is fingerprint and I have a phone that only does Face ID. This is very annoying when I have appointments this week and this summer and I can’t access my info! Both the app and the website won’t let me submit a form for support so this is my only option.,2021-06-07 15:32:18
Nice app but quick question,False,4,Reck 1,"So I’ve had this app on my phone for a year or so and it’s nice and easy to navigate. I also use the apple Health app on my watch and phone. From workouts to heart rate and hand washing it’s all in one place. It offers the ability to add hundreds of third party health apps but Healow is not available.
Can we make this happen?",2020-12-29 00:02:25
"If I could rate 0, I would.",False,1,Productivity Pro,"Hours this weekend trying to set up. Today(Monday) went with the iOS APP.  The screens are tiny and every time I looked at a lab result, instead of letting me click on the next result it sent me to the home screen again each time.  So much wasted time.  Cannot review results over time. Very disorganized and confusing. If this is how I will have to communicate with my medical practice, I will have to make a change. I hope I can still call my doctor’s office and talk to a person. So sad.",2021-02-09 00:17:59
Very frustrating,False,2,MimiBex Austin TX,"I was asked to set this up for a first visit.  It pulled in my prescriptions but the information on doses is flawed.  Some are missing.  All the function given was to accept on hide, no way to edit.

I was told they had all my records but the app didn’t pull any up.  I only hope the office can give me forms to complete or explain.  I hate taking 30 minutes to fill out forms in the office where I may not have access to info.",2021-01-25 04:19:57
Dr Figueras & Staff,False,5,Scottish8,"You could not ask for a better team of staff for care from the front desk to the back of the office they are all so very kind as soon as you walk in the door. 
Dr Figueras takes his time to listen and takes care of you the way a caring doctor should. 
I highly recommend him as my doctor for anyone 
who needs care.",2018-09-26 18:47:52
Improvement needed,False,3,K-reen,"The app is great for that it is BUT major problem. Impossible to contact support. Submitting support request will not work and give error message due to their server being down. 
Then trying to change setting is impossible. I have set my kid to be Myself so it set’s me as child and it is impossible to change. 
as I said needs major improvements",2021-02-24 16:00:43
Wonderful but no notification?!?!,False,4,Criccardo,"I wish All of my drs used this app. It really allows me the convenience of contacting my dr without going through the hassle of leaving msgs and waiting or missing a return call. Only issue I notice is my iPhone doesn’t give a notification when I receive a msg. I’ve missed several important msgs too many days too late.

Plz add this in an update!!",2018-03-20 23:51:16
Runner9,False,5,23 years,I think it’s one of the better apps than I had to get you all the information you need it works very well and contact your daughter you can check on your appointments you can check in with your physical therapist it works very well,2022-04-14 23:23:11
Fair app could be better,False,3,joelatl,"I like using the app to see the dates of my appointment and ability to check in when arriving. 
My meds include the number of refills but do not show the date prescribed for me to know if it’s time to ask for a new prescription.  My physician was surprised when I mentioned it.  I have to use my retail pharmacy’s app for knowing when to request a new script  ahead of time.",2021-08-08 12:03:12
Useless,False,1,dlowfly,"I have several doctors in the system with back surgery and throat surgery from 2 surgeons under my belt.  The only thing this app shows is two outdated medications and that is all.  Nothing more. No records, labs, appointments, or any other information.  Zero.  0.  I could find the same amount of information in my refrigerator or under a rock and I don’t have to spend 30 minutes trying to log into those. Next time I need to look at my records I’ll just go look in a tree or ask the guy that lives on the bench across the street.  Mmkay?",2018-05-06 04:48:36
Happy mom,False,5,Solution ros,Love this app it helps me keep up with what’s happening with each my children and to keep up with up coming appointments I can see test results and if there is a problem I’m a grateful mom this helps so much with keep me organized with multiple children,2022-04-22 14:46:56
Volusia Medical Center,False,3,MeTimeMommy,I LOVE THIS APP. To bad my doctors office doesn’t care to use it properly. Hopefully the developers can see this and contact the New Smyrna Beach office and help the staff and physicians learn how to use this. In NY the health app was incredible. It helped that the different doctors and staff knew how to receive and send messages. In FL doesn’t seem like they have any interest in learning. My hope is they get some training down here so that the app can be truly appreciated by all.,2018-03-15 13:34:55
Only as good as the information supplied by the provider,False,4,Philowell,"The pros:
All my meds and lab results in one place. Ease and portability for use at other Drs offices.
The cons:
Labs showed that I needed vaccination booster which I received. Dr did not note this in the Vaccination section so I could not print that out for my work
Many of the medications listed were old or only used once eg antibiotics for sinus infection, and I couldn’t update",2019-05-14 12:48:38
Messages doesn’t work. Not iPhone X ready,False,1,Mark in SLC,"If you send a message over some unknown limit the message fails to send and misreports the error as “Special characters are not allowed”. Frustrating because I spend my time editing my message down to a single sentence. Besides, how hard would it be to use UITextFieldDelegate’s “allowCharacters:inRange:” function to prevent malformed characters?  Also, Apple will soon not allow new apps unless they are iPhone X ready, which this one isn’t. That gives you some idea of their commitment to keeping this app fresh.",2018-05-14 23:54:38
What's the point?!,False,2,mrs. c@RReR@,"Not sure if it's the app or the users but it has nothing in it but appointments. If the doctors are going to recommend something like this it should at least be updated with information. I'm trying to see my kids shot records (which they have) and they're not in there. My son just had a physical about a month ago and none of the stats are present! What the heck? I don't need this app for appointments, I get enough texts and emails to confirm those as a reminder!",2017-05-25 20:53:28
Requires microphone and camera access? Awful requirement,False,1,ChristianRiley,"Talk about a bad design decision requiring both microphone and camera access to get into the app even though you were only using it to access records from your provider. Sure, if we want to do tele visits, I can see it, but they only use it for records and I am not giving an app access when I don’t have to do so. Rethink that please.

Also the codes needed and not pulling info from the practice makes this a bad overall experience",2022-01-10 23:32:59
Multiple users,False,3,Gutek123,"In order to switch between users in my case I have two children, I have to log out and sign back in with credentials. I wish you had within application an option to switch between users. Just find it annoying to log back in each time. Hope this will be a next improvement on this application. Thank you.",2019-05-14 22:30:40
Useless,False,2,Inspector Gadget 2324,"This could be a great app but it it obvious the developers launched this way to early.  The only option that worked for me was to see my appointment.  Entered medication but there is no way, that I can find, to delete or correct a previously enter med.  Entered notes and they disappeared.   Tried to sign in with my iPad and the app  indicated I entered the wrong information which I did not.  Interestingly the same process (wrong information) occurred when I first tried the app on my iPhone.",2017-08-19 11:12:54
Worse developers ever,False,1,Nosequepasochiko,Website is bad app is even worse can't even login this is obviously from an iPhone the webpage doesn't allow me to login through safari only on chrome web browser in addition the app doesn't allow me to login because all I could do is search for a provider and mines is not even on the app but through google chrome I was able to access my account and retrieve my information shame on you for delivering such a horrible product for something as important as medical records,2017-07-03 13:27:40
Nowhere near as useful as the web portals,False,2,Altcatred,"In theory this could be super useful. In reality all I ever use this for is to check when I have appointments. Messaging providers through this app is SEVERELY restricted compared to when I message my Drs or PAs through the web portal. It’s practically useless. The records section has admittedly gotten better than when I first downloaded the app, but honestly I find the messaging so annoying I hardly use this anymore.",2021-11-28 23:51:06
"um, ...no. I wouldn't advise usage.",False,2,Mr Kylhappy,"I'm being totally fair and candid about my feelings for this app. But not just mine, I'm putting in a word for my current doctor( whom I will not name ). And just by my layperson's viewpoint of how well both of us felt at the time of my appointment, I'll come right to the point, we had a terrible time with the overall usage of your app. I've got other issues that make further usage of your app, by me, incredibly impossible.",2020-10-08 03:17:53
Emailed for help,False,5,Itsdaybyday,"I was having trouble with my app so I sent them an email asking for help. Not only did I get a reply but after a few emails back and forth got the problem resolved. It was an awesome and amazing to get the help I needed. I have deleted so many apps because there was no help. 
Thanks for such a great app.

Interesting.,False,5,AndyMunozSLC,"It’s an interesting way to find out if you have an STD or not, the suspense of scrolling and swiping left to right to reveal wether you have some crazy disease is fun! Luckily nothing crazy came back positive, but imagine finding out you’re knocking on death’s door by using this app, before the doctor has time to call you. Lol.",2018-03-24 13:45:02
Clunky and not user friendly,False,1,The_Dana,"I wanted this to be more useful than it has been. It requires me to log in multiple users (my son and I), and claims it’s possible, but after linking the accounts several times, it doesn’t show up under the “other users”. I just get caught in a circle of misery trying to link them. You can’t submit a question to the company without being a doctor/provider so you’re just stuck dealing with its crappy UI on your own. Not a fan.",2022-03-29 18:07:56
Undo latest update,False,1,Ryan_nicole,"I don’t know what kind of update Healow recently did but y’all need to undo it. I’ve never had a passcode for my phone and because of that it now won’t allow me into the app. I’ve never had an issue with it until now. I should not have to have a phone passcode to get into an app that is already passcode protected. My review is a review on the update. As far as the actual app goes, it’s good and useful but now I can’t access it because I don’t have a phone password. Stupid.",2021-11-13 00:31:19
Passcode,False,3,kpajulie,"I agree with those who are frustrated because a passcode is now required for your device.  I do understand privacy issues but feel it invades my privacy when I have to set something up on my iPad and iPhone that personally I have chosen not to use for years. 
Please return to just a passcode or fingerprint for app access without the device passcode.",2021-12-04 18:36:52
Simplify,False,5,Tired Lucy,"Very helpful App. I can email the Doctor and get an answer quickly. Saves a lot of time and phone calls, and the worst, waiting for a return call that you might miss.
You have all your prescriptions on your phone with the correct spelling! Handy when you’re at another Doctors office.",2018-10-04 06:23:52
Useless Ap,False,1,lucycmhmi,"This ap is useless and unsure why I even needed to upload it. I was told it would have everything I need at my fingertips. Waste of time. 

My medical history is incomplete: missing my vaccines and at least 9 out of 10 years visit history and lab work history. Also there is no  billing section for me to keep everything straight. I don’t want one portal for billing and one for health. Too many log ins to keep track of. 

The idea was good but the execution is poor.",2022-01-25 18:05:32
Great app!,False,5,Mrs.Hölljes,I really appreciate being able to communicate with my doctor via the message center. I am unable to speak on the phone due to a voice disorder and this app allows me to reach out to my doctors without having to ask someone to call for me or drive there in person!,2019-02-15 16:42:54
How you request med refills after the latest update.,False,4,iamjanesbaby,"It took some time for me to figure out how to request a refill on my meds with the update. I was kinda annoyed but it’s all good now. 
For the person a few reviews ahead of me,  @ dehaughted: Go to “my records” and click on medications and then the + sign. That is where you can request meds. 
Hope it helps. 🙂",2019-01-11 05:25:00
Nice App,False,5,stevebmidtn,"Maybe some of the reviews below are people that are challenged by their devices in general or their Dr doesn’t use the app correctly but I have no problems at all with the functionality or features. On the contrary, this app gives me all the tools I need to interact with my providers and medical information.",2019-01-02 18:08:24
No bill pay feature on my app… clunky and not user friendly.,False,3,dunn85,I personally use this and so do my patients and no one likes it. Half the time ask the paperwork you fill out on it won’t translate to the system and half the people just plain can’t use it. Only thing I like is that I can message the Dr. Directly and the lab notifications.,2022-03-01 13:19:59
Bugs,False,2,mimzi2,"I’ve used this app for a few years now, but recently there’ve been problems. I tried requesting a simple refill via the app, but the menu is blank when I do a search for my provider- even though I’m logged on and the provider is listed at the top of the screen. Weird. I have to call my doc now- and be put on hold. What a waste! The app was designed to streamline these things and it fails.",2021-08-23 04:20:03
Horrible App,False,1,kyleh24,This is the worst App ever! It never functions as it should and it is designed horribly. It's nearly impossible to find what you're looking for and it is so buggy. I used to be able to view certain kinds of test results but can no longer do so with this version! That's kind of annoying to say the least. Trying to message the doctor and view sent messages is a joke. A health app that is important for communication with your doctor should really be designed a lot better!,2017-05-24 03:34:48
Worthless waste of time.,False,1,Texaswise,"This app gets totally screwed up when you have more than one of yours doctors’ practices that use it.  Even though the second practice shows up in the app, I get a login error when I select it - even after I enter my pin.  I plan on letting my health care providers know that I refuse to use this garbage app.  If they can’t handle that I’ll find another health provider.  If I could rate this app lower than one star I certainly should.  It should get negative stars.",2022-03-18 14:37:32
Apple Health,False,4,Clamper1827,"Would love if this app would allow to share data to Apple Health so the blood pressure medicine will go into the fitness information. Just finished a 2 1/2 hour ride, over 33 miles and shows only 21 minutes of exercise. If I can link this to show the medicine I could get that resolved. Thank you.",2021-10-16 17:13:33
Horrible UI. Impossible to get help!,False,1,eightyanthony,There are so many things wrong with this app that if you are a health provider thinking of using healow; Call me. Here’s my personal number. I will walk you through the difficulties involved with this app. I couldn’t even create a help ticket because the app broke. You know when everything doesn’t work down to the captcha not even having an enter button?  I searched online for an email. Any email to find help.  No way to get any.,2020-12-07 23:58:23
Still too many bugs,False,3,KA572917647/8,"The app allows you to see test results when they’re ready but it’s functionality is very spotty. Trying to add a second child to the account is impossible. 

The icons often don’t work and it’s impossible to navigate around. It would have been faster to just call the Dr for the results.",2020-10-20 19:33:07
Payments,False,1,Nothere2,Difficult to use the app for multiple reasons. I was required to use it for the last 2 years and thankfully my doctor is going to another system. I just paid my last bill.  The billing part of this system is the worst part because the forms don’t appear completely. I won’t have to worry anymore about spending an hour clicking on blank parts of the buggy pages to process a single payment.,2022-02-02 01:40:59
Cannot successfully refill Rx on this app,False,1,Trfhgdthhfthfhjj,"I have had the same issue with this app for years. When requesting a refill, The pharmacy selection search function does not work properly.

Please improve this search function, it is unusable.",2021-10-04 16:17:31
Can’t reply to emails received,False,3,linny2018,It’s a little disappointing to get emails from a doctor and not be able to reply back to that same email but have to compose a whole brand new email. The only place I can do a reply is when I sign into the website but I can’t do it on my iPhone app that is why I’m giving this only three stars right now,2020-05-27 16:44:41
Healow,False,4,riverdar,"The app is easy to use and a great way to communicate with my medical team. I can check future and past appointments, lab work done and keep my doctor aware of medical issues that occur between physical appointments.

Awesome,False,5,Mayeboo,Awesome and empathy right treatment easy to used for people who knows how to used computer and also for the ones who are in to the transition from paper progress note to ECW saves time and it keeps everything organized and also track of mistakes in the medical field with exited to work.,2019-04-30 01:51:02
Awful app! App maker should be ashamed.,False,1,Paulski,"I’ve been attempting to message with my doctor on this app only to find out that:
1)you cannot see the full response/message. I discovered that by copying the text and pasting it into a new massage would show text which is not visible when the message is open in the inbox
2)there appears to be no ability to reply directly to messages, meaning if I want to reply to my doctor I have to start a new email string

Also the app design is ridiculously dated. Not certain who’s grandparent designed the app but it is in dire need of a refresh. 

The makers of this app should be ashamed of what they’ve created. I hope they’ll correct these issues soon but in the meantime I will seek out other ways of communicating with my doctor.",2021-02-26 21:02:16
Tech farce!  Change your passwords people!!!!,False,1,Looschange,"If I did work like this developer did, I would be living in a shelter.  You should be embarrassed and get to work fixing this. I was locked out because I selected to read the fine print on the registration links. Anybody could have done better roto-tilling a Victrola and a ham radio together with a brick phone..  I really hope that they did not charge me for this app. Now I’m forced to wait all afternoon for the doctor's possibly calling me for a phone conference.",2020-03-31 18:54:29
"Seems promising, needs HealthKit support",False,3,William R. Dickson,"As far as the basics — viewing health records, checking appointments, etc., the app seems to work as expected. However, it’s disappointing that it can’t pull or push data to the Health app, which is the central repository for all health data on any iPhone.

Great App to Review & Manage Tests across Physicians,False,5,etcrushabh57,"Great app to manage all your medical reports and check doctor notes.

Use it Quite Frequently,False,4,Magnolia49,"I can use it to let my doctor know my condition, to ask for an appointment, or for anything related to my health.

Good foundation just needs improvements,False,2,GH list,"Messaging needs to be much smoother allow you to reply. Also would like to be able to message the practice as a whole to contact the admin staff not only a specific provider.

⚠️ WARNING ⚠️ Horrible Privacy Policy & Practices. Buggy.  F- Support.,False,1,JesusBenNazareth,"I read the privacy policy when my providers’ office announced the tool and it was so bad I refused to install it. The terms of service are horrific! Binding arbitration adhesion contract! Sharing of data with “partners”, namely ADVERTISERS! Requires you accept pop-up notifications from said advertisers!  They might as well include the sale of your soul and your first born. 

Then a year later I was having trouble with appointments and I needed to know what was in their system so I had to install it. 
Then I ran into bugs and took screenshots and sent them in.
Results: Dismal. Prakash claims it’s NOT a bug that alerts don’t show up right when set and **don’t go off**.
Prakash needs to be fired for this!!  He even refuses to let me communicate with anyone else.",2020-11-14 23:28:19
Can’t reply to messages with app,False,1,J. Heinrich,"This would be a great portal if you could have a conversation with your provider from your inbox. All messages show, but there is no place to reply. In the browser based portal, there’s a “reply” button that allows you to have a thread of messages on the same subject. For some reason, that functionality isn’t available in the app.

Also noteworthy, the browser portal messages don’t let you use apostrophes and consider them “special characters”. How bizarre.",2020-03-28 13:52:35
Disconnect with my doctor and goofy tech support.,False,1,wondering_if,"Well, I thought the app would be helpful, but it seems that data from my doctor doesn’t flow easily from their application on their laptop to the portal where I can see it.  I reported the problem via the iOS app including the doctors name and contact info.  The app support team replied and wanted me to chase down the problem with my doctor.  Excuse me?   Sorry.  Terrible off-shore tech support with no idea of what the doctor-patient environment is like.  Clearly a management problem.",2019-03-25 21:32:00
"Has potential, but badly implemented",False,1,graphwit,"I am very frustrated when I use this app. It has a lot of potential, but is badly implemented, and has a variety of bugs. The email feature is particularly frustrating. Poorly written app!

One important feature that is missing is compatibility with health tracking apps, so that daily tracking of blood pressure, activity, diet, etc. can be accessed by my physician through this app, which then becomes part of my medical record. A very valuable opportunity is being missed.",2017-09-05 19:00:00
Unimpressed,False,1,good luck finding a nickname that isn't taken,"Unless you have a highly progressive pediatric practice with early adoption of medical technology many of the features are useless.  My appointment times are always listed incorrectly, too.  My actual appointment is always 1 hour later than the listed time and no setting to correct this.

Useful for sending a message,False,2,DicanNoman,"This app is only useful for sending a message to your doctor, seeing medications list and seeing your appointments. The payment and bill statement portion that it claims to do, isn’t actually a thing and it’s very slow. I saw that it hasn’t been updated in over 2 months, so I think it’s overdue then.

Healow,False,5,By Laceypandora,I love this app if it wasn’t for healow I wouldn’t know anything about my lab results or my EKG’s . Healow makes it so my Dr has to explain to me what’s going on with all my results. I really believe I would be still in the dark about so much my Dr doesn't tell me.

Useful but flawed,False,2,aka Hersh,"Above anything else, the inability (as far as I can tell) to be able to adjust the font size is really frustrating. Like, hugely.

Tech issues,False,1,Blucr,"I don’t like that it requires you to have a password on your phone in order to open the app. It’s annoying. The app already has a password and I don’t like having a password on my phone. I don’t feel it should be up to the app to decide whether I do or not. 

Secondly, I think the inbox/messaging system needs a reply function. In order to confirm something with a doctor/RN I have to compose a completely new message with a new subject.",2021-11-17 22:35:55

Waste of time,False,1,maddyoo,"I received an invite from my office, followed the instructions in the email, went to the web page first then downloaded the app.  At no point did it ask me for a password set up.  I can’t even change my password because I don’t have one to begin with.  

There is no information loaded, just billing.  No 2 way communication or symptom reporting. And there was one 1 of the questionnaires I had to fill out at my appointment.  Would have saved the staff time if they sent before my appt.",2020-05-08 13:11:27
Kixx,False,5,spookey tooth,This has worked for me in a good way it gets me to two doctors that I have listed saves me so much time and keeps my medications and visits so lots of times I need a refill I would call and get a recording but this better they answer when they get time so great a great app. Five stars from me.,2019-03-11 14:32:12
Messages are awful and notifications don’t work,False,2,UltramaticXY,Using this app to communicate with your provider is an exercise in frustration. Messages aren’t threaded and the message composition will not allow special characters like apostrophes. Also there is something wrong with message notifications. I have notifications turned on but I’ve missed several messages from my doctor since you don’t get notified.,2018-11-30 01:30:25
Used to work - Update,False,5,kwb77,"Amen for the fix!!!! Thank you!
Worked great until last update. I can no longer log in or do a search to find my provider. No response from customer service yet.",2020-05-15 20:43:38
failed,False,1,failure1234,"Tried several times to register. Would not allow me to do so. Told passwd was weak. It was not. Wanted a backup security question. None applied so created my own, an option, but would not let me confirm answer which was required, so there we set. This is one of the worse apps I have ever had to deal with. Cannot believe anybody would float this thing in this condition. You would think you were registering for entering Ft. Knox (Review from a ex software engineer).",2021-06-23 12:41:10
Waste for health tracking,False,1,jplaya5174,This app gives you the ability to track data by linking accounts but it hasn’t worked yet with pulling data from Withings/Nokia heathmate for the last 5 years. It would be good to be able to show your doctor your health habits without a face to face meeting but I guess they don’t care about that. I have linked and unlinked this multiple times and have never seen any results. Trash app. Only thing it’s good for is receiving information from you doctor.,2019-01-11 21:01:52
Glitches?,False,3,stevecapa1,"Not sure if there's problems with the app or my doctors office, the first problem is I can't reorder my meds, I added them so there is a list but when I tap refill there's no listed meds.
The second problem is my doctor isn't listed to send an email to refill said meds, although he is for upcoming appointments.",2021-08-23 01:31:07
Review of App,False,2,watermelon60#,"I’m very disappointed that this app is not more user friendly. 
When corresponding with physicians, you can not see previous correspondence and the running dialogue to address medical needs. Other patient portals are easy to navigate, show all correspondence and does not require bouncing back and forth between different screens. This app causes more frustration than necessary. I’d rather leave a message at the doctors office and wait for a response.",2018-07-25 17:58:31
Shills non-Apple tracking devices,False,1,SF Redbeard,"Shills for biometric tracking devices (i.e., Fitbit, Nokia, jawbone, etc.). They actually sell these devices in-app. The appraisal does not work with iWatch or iPhone?! Basic data availabe in web browser is not available in the app--medications, for example.

The one other review posted (with 5 stars no less) has nothing do do with evaluating the app. It should be taken down. The misleading ""review"" is nothing more then a page from ""Whisky Wendy's"" diary idealizing her medical provider and his or her ancillary staff.  Laughably disingenuous.",2018-03-01 08:04:32
easy to use app!,False,5,Ocean99919,I love this app because it is so easy to get information and it is so clear and easy. The other family practice at is very difficult and I can never get it to work but this one works beautifully on my phone. Very happy with it,2017-07-12 01:42:24
Missing facts,False,1,Disappointed Dolphin,I just read the developers remarks about the app. The remarks failed to mention that in order to use this app you must set up a passcode to enslave your phone. Now another problem has been introduced. For the people who already have a phone passcode; no problem. For those who have to set up a passcode that now controls your phone; it seems like a lot of over kill. So not using this app till this problem is gone,2022-02-26 15:46:44
Decent app,False,3,rozell78,"The app is decent.  Two issues I’m experiencing.

1.  The visit summaries won’t load in the app.  It says “an error occurred”.  The visit summaries do load via the website.

2.  Lab result notifications are sporadic at best.  Sometimes I get an email a few days after they’ve been released.  Why not a push notification or immediate email when the doctor releases the results?",2019-09-16 02:00:10
AppleCare Medical Group,False,5,SmallnHappy patient,This app has made my appointments go by much smoother with the simple check in process. No waiting in lines or repeating my personal info in front of others at the front desk. Thank you Dr. Ganguly and the amazing team in Downey for updating your available services to patients like me!,2019-11-23 16:41:16
App needs work,False,2,revelriter,"The app has a lot of promising functionality, but it does not yet work well for basic functions like sending and replying to messages from your physician. For example, there is no “reply to message” function. You have to start a new message off of the thread. Also, for some odd reason the system won’t allow you to send messages with quotation marks or apostrophes, so contractions result in an error message.",2018-06-18 16:13:17
Frustrating at best,False,2,Flm_grl,"This app is frustrating at best. You have a new sign-in for every doctor’s office. Trying to merge your doctors/appointments/accounts into one is excruciating. It might be nice once you have access to everything in one place, but getting access to everything in one place is a near impossibility. I’m having great difficulty. I will say, though, it may be due in part to iOS 14.",2020-09-30 21:53:09
Terrible app,False,1,~TimMe~87,"Never finds my doctors even when all the information is correct, won’t let you view messages, and constantly throws errors forcing you to log out. Once you log out of the app you realize it didn’t save any of your information or doctors. Now you must go thru the pain in the aaa struggle to find the doctors it never seems to be able to find! Fix this app so we can get our medical information done, please!",2020-05-15 23:03:21
needs a reply feature,False,3,onepatient,"The app functions Okay but it needs a “reply” option for messages. When I need to reply to a message, I have to start a new message. My provider doesn’t like this either. She said it makes it difficult to find info on a patient in the messages list.",2022-04-06 13:51:37
The app’s limits are frustrating,False,2,Bearealman1959,"For one, the default text font size is tiny. I don’t wear glasses all the time and I can’t imagine what people with lesser eyesight must have to deal with. 

A list of one’s medications on record is nice, but not being able to make a direct prescription refill or renewal is weird. 

A list of messages from my primary doctors’ office is fine, but not being able to delete them is odd.

Best as I can tell, the way to use the app to contact my primary is to use their messages function. But I can’t address the message to my primary doctor by name. (Just mention it in the message body). And one would think there’d be functionality such as for prescriptions to make specific common requests.",2018-08-27 17:42:05
Still waiting for the dr’s office to get the machine,False,2,msblaque,"I’m sure it would work correctly if 1. my doctor’s office had the check in station for me to check in. 2. If all my vitals would be on the app like it’s supposed to.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t 3. If you were able to make appointments with the app. 4. If the results were there to see. 
I’ve had this app on my phone for 2 years. The only thing it does is REMIND ME OF MY APPOINTMENT.",2017-12-11 19:15:59
Hate. Hate. Hate.,False,2,A&E.,"It has its own passcode to enter, but I despise that it requires my phone to also have a passcode in order for me to use it. Infuriating.

The messaging isn’t easy. There’s no reply feature - you have to start a new message every time. Plus, there’s no way to attach files/photos. 

I have used many patient portal apps between my kids and myself.  This is the worst so far.",2022-04-18 19:03:34
Healow App,False,3,Confused Granna,"It is ok.  I have had a hard time trying to get some of the information, like, “profile”, change phone numbers, and insurance to change to the correct information.  I called the Dr.s office to see if they could help with the changes, and I talked to someone to help change some information, and I was told to call the Dr’s office...being past around!  Confused!",2019-01-06 15:16:33
Completely useless,False,1,Hyhrhdhjhhhddyuifgfgftg,"What is the point of this app if I can’t even email my doctor? That was literally the whole reason I downloaded it. When I try to compose an email, you have to select a provider first. No matter what you search for in the provider search bar the result is the same, “no results found”... Because no results are found I am unable to move forward with sending an email. Useless.",2020-10-01 21:34:00
Microphone and Camera Required,False,1,Mama33bobs,"There is no reason this app should REQUIRE camera and video access to use. Yes, there MAY be situations (like a telehealth visit) where it is needed, and I would allow it then, but a requirement to use is bordering on privacy concerns. It greatly makes me question the company’s HIPPA compliance. 

If my clinic hadn’t switched to this company after two other bad ones I would strongly recommend they switch again.  I will not be using this app.",2020-06-16 02:53:58
Print is too small and light!!! Difficult to read,False,2,Pitbull928,I am not happy with this new update. What I don’t like about this new update which I was forced to download is that the letters are smaller and lighter than before so it makes it very difficult to read. I have to now struggle to read my results. I get that these developers want it to look aesthetically pleasing but they forgot about their audience and MISSED the mark on functionality!!!,2019-07-04 13:40:13
Super convenient app,False,4,danpo77,"Love that I can see/set my appointments, see lab results, and even message my doctor. I Love the app and I only have one tiny complaint, I wish the app was more optimized for the iPhone X to really use up the whole screen and not have the awkward empty space on the top and bottom. Everything else is perfect.",2018-10-13 13:30:27
What’s the point?,False,1,Countryboybillyum,"This app is absolutely useless. You can sign in, sure. Need to access your results that have been posted? Oh well, better luck next time? It will alert you that it has been updated with results but you can not access them… try signing in on to the web browser… that’s also a fun game… literally the absolute worst app and sign in experience you’ll have. I have never used such a mess of an app.",2022-04-08 22:34:42
Cannot Share info to Apple Health app,False,3,mal626,The app is great but we should really have the option to share all of our test results/vitals with Apple Health app. Some of us would like to have all of our data in one central app since other workout apps sync to Apple Health as well. Please have. Away to sync data from the Healow app to the Apple Health app. Thank you !,2020-08-19 12:43:41
Need phone passcode to use at all,False,2,Giraffegurl123,"I tried to download and use this app but it won’t let you even create an account unless you’ve set up some sort of passcode for your smartphone. I guess most people already have a passcode, but I don’t and I don’t want one. I see no reason why they can’t implement their own passcode system if privacy is so important to them. Anyway Im deleting the app now.",2022-03-13 20:28:28
"Use your phone’s browser, it works better",False,2,angry kitten,"I am NEVER “found in the system” even when sitting in an exam room at my doctor’s office with the log-in credentials in front of me, and I’m done trying. I’m probably doing something wrong, but I can log in from a browser by entering my phone number (most of the time) so screw an app that just takes up space on my phone.",2022-02-07 16:08:05
Not bad but has a ways to go,False,3,W|ldb0y,"I've been using the app for a few days and most of it is pretty good but I have a few suggestions

1) lets users manage their medication list i.e. Mark when they're done taking a medication
2) when searching for a doctor, results list are blank on available times when your website clearly shows available time slots for my preferred provider. 
3) user preferences could simplify searches by pre-populating fields with previous providers

In general appointments and medical records should be beefed up in functionality as these are the primary purpose people use the app

Good try but needs some work.",2017-06-21 08:54:57
Test before releasing?,False,1,garskoci,"This app is really poorly written. There are a number of issues with it  such as, i have messages from the nurse and it won't pull them up. It shows 9 medications and when i look at them, there none. It keeps telling me that I need to link my provider, then when I try and link my doc, it says that she's already there. It's a waste of time. Just like when the developers considered testing before releasing. The early version worked. This one? Removed.",2017-07-26 11:37:38
Awesome,False,5,yomhtac,"Can't complain but, one suggestion that your notes that we add show up for our Dr's to be able too see or print out for them so we can discuss with them. The notes disappear on your appointment date but other than that it's an awesome app",2017-07-20 15:00:45
Worthless app,False,1,Juanmotime33,"I’m a physician and I would be embarrassed to have my patients try to use this extremely poorly designed app.  Undoubtedly, like most electronic record systems in medicine, this app was not designed for users and healthcare providers, but for accountants and office managers.  I would wonder if the app is as bad on that end as it is on my end.  And I’m sure this “service” is provided at an incredibly high cost, despite its poor functionality.",2022-01-05 17:34:02
App won’t load,False,1,Chrisd56,"I’m giving a one for the current issue. Generally it’s kind of clunky and you can’t reply directly to emails here you have to create a new email EVERY. TIME. BEYOND ANNOYING. 

Currently the app loads and then gives an error message as soon as you try to click a message. Wish it worked better or the developers would fix the issues. Might try to uninstall and reinstall and see if that works.",2021-09-24 01:49:21
FRUSTRATING,False,1,Telanda,"App and website are different.  Can log into website but not the app.  All removed my other two children, now i can’t add them!!

Useless,False,1,MostAppsFail,"Started setting up a week before appointment. App wouldn’t accept password for provider portal, so I had to change password.  Then it said my I Mac wouldn’t support televisit even though it met all operating requirements. So I put it on both iPhone and iPad. Morning of appointment went through all set up again to make sure it worked. Then I sat 45 minutes in front of a screen saying Dr “X” would join shortly.

Very helpful in my medical care,False,5,saulbro,"The practice and hospital I use for my medical needs are very responsive to my messages and in getting results of various tests.

Forced to follow,False,2,Cafasr,"I have been a long time user of this app, and loved it!!   Until, I was forced to have to set up a passcode for my phone to be able to use the app.  I have never used a passcode on my phone and I don’t want to now.  My phone is never left out and is always with me.  So, please change the app, so that you can use it without having to passcode your phone.",2022-02-09 12:10:23
Forcing passcode,False,2,KayNein,"I was finally getting the hang of this app but now it’s requiring me to put a passcode on my phone in order to use it, which is ridiculous. What do I have a pin for then? Make a better password system instead of a 4  digit pin if you’re worried about security. Don’t make someone passcode their WHOLE PHONE. Wont be using this until that feature is removed.",2021-11-02 18:00:35
You agree to have adverts served to you in your doctors portal,False,1,GotNate,"The second time I used this app, it started me over with a new onboarding process, as if I had never used it. This onboarding made me agree to the t&c before I could read messages from my doctor. As is typical, they reserve the right to alter the deal whenever they like, without notice. They all require you to agree to be served adverts. I deleted the app and used my doctors website instead.",2021-12-29 18:09:59
Needs improvement,False,2,Sunflowaah,"I sent a message to my doctor on Thursday during the day and the sent messages show it sent at 2:30am today, a Wednesday. I went to the support tab, it won’t load & neither will the report a problem tab. My WiFi is full bars, it’s not my end.

Absolute nightmare,False,1,kmichaelaye,"The whole login and password interface is completely unusable on the iPhone.
The text entry fields continuously go out of focus, so that it’s very hard to copy secure passwords from your password manager in.

Useless,False,1,Ms.Flutey,"This app takes forever to retrieve data. It takes ok 2 minutes to switch from my appointment list to the notes on one of those appointments. The text is so small and light gray that the only way to read it is to take a screen shot, increase the contrast, and then zoom in to the part I want to read. What a complete waste of my time.

Really not a good app,False,1,Dobie McArthur,"I use this only because my doctor’s office uses it. Does not work well. Not intuitive and generally difficult to get anything done. Hard to believe my doctor couldn’t find a better app.

User friendly?,False,2,94jag,This app is not very user friendly.  When trying to find my provider the app had a hard time locating my Doctor by name.

Really clunky but then it has two party authentication (probably required by some HIPPA law) so kudos for having the two party authentication.,2021-04-30 12:03:36
Not user friendly,False,2,needsworkthisisannoying,"I love the theory, but this app is not the least bit user friendly. If the point is to link all your providers together for easier communication, why is everything so separate and difficult to navigate? Trying to set up a new account with a dr office is a nightmare.

Clumsy and Useless,False,1,jfthomas,"One would think that an app such as this is meant to make things more convenient, but this app fails miserably.  It really serves no useful purpose.  For example:  An obvious function (to me, at least) of the app would be the ability to export an appointment to the iOS calendar.  With this app, it’s not even possible to copy text for the purpose of pasting into the calendar.

Dismal onboarding experience,False,1,Pcendeavorsny,Wants everything. Required everything. Forced you to engage or not have access to labs. Twisted twisted or just badly designed. This app is an example of why there are trust issues between people and service providers. I just want my bleeping results. I don’t want to authorize a million things and as soon as I get my results I intend to record and delete the app and all such permission.  You made it weird and creepy.,2021-10-21 14:04:32

Finally, it can’t seem to locate my doctor or the practice. Very annoying and frustrating app to use. More like, can’t use because it doesn’t work.",2021-07-09 13:31:24
Worst medical practitioner APP,False,1,Your nameistaken,"This app may please the medical practitioners, but it is user unfriendly and 99% of the time the practitioner cannot be located.  It fails on several fronts:  practicality, time, and justification of it's difficulty to use.  Hello!  Not all patients are computer whizzes.  I have a good grasp of how to operate most other apps in this field, but I’m not going to spend  time trying to communicate in this manner when there are many great, safe apps available.",2021-02-23 01:15:00
Medical records,False,5,Wade.Susan,"My doctor is with optima and I am seen in Prescott, AZ.  They are so great about updating my records! This ap is great! I always forget my appts and I can look on this ap very quickly to see when my Appointments are! It’s so fast too! Thanks",2020-10-28 00:19:02
Hideous login experience,False,1,silverspace,"The mobile app uses a PIN to log in, not the credentials from the web site. It should allow me to use the web site credentials and my password keychain to store the credentials.

Also, it seems that if I don’t log in often enough, the credentials expire. I do not see my doctor that often, so the net result is that every time I try to login, I have to phone my provider and reset the password.",2020-10-15 22:01:07
"Not so great, but could be.",False,2,Ritgo,"Glad we have this connection to our doctor. When composing messages, the search feature does not always find my doctor, and there are too many steps to go through to compose a message.

Useless App,False,1,bicwood,"I do not know if it is a problem with the app or a problem with HCA/St. David’s  practice administration, but the result is that this app is useless.  There are always issues with logging in and today (June, 2020) the latest data I could see was from April 2019.  This type of thing has been an ongoing problem.  If you try to talk to the clinic people about it, they just complain about all of their issues with the software.",2020-06-29 14:29:00
Worst Health App Ever,False,1,peooelel,"My physician has wasted money on this application.  Even after the support desk helped the office with the appointment section of the app, the only thing I can see is past appointments.  On top of that, I can’t see anything in most other sections of the app.  This app doesn’t even work on my desktop.  If it were up to me, I’d fire this company because there are better apps out there.  I know this because my other physicians have apps that work very well.",2020-02-06 15:17:28
No Apple Health Connection?!?,False,3,Wafflechipbball,"I like this app, it keeps all my doctor I for in one place, but I'm extremely disappointed that I can't connect my Apple Health App or my Apple Watch! If this app is available on the Apple Store, why can't I connect anything Apple related to the app?! It's the best way to track health on iPhones, what sense does it make that we can't connect it?!?! Please add support for this...",2017-07-27 17:00:02
No special characters allowed?,False,2,KellyMakesThings,"Every time I try and send a message to my doctor, I have to go back in and remove any ‘special characters’ before the message will send. Apparently an apostrophe counts as ‘special’??

Please repair it so that shortcuts like the use of conjunctions, ampersands, etc are allowed. Having to comb through my message and pull out characters in order to get my message to send is driving me bananas!",2018-11-02 13:44:24
Love the convenience,False,3,Vango1972,The platform for this app is awesome. I think the only thing I dislike about it is it does not send you notifications. I have to manually go in and look for a response even though the settings I have are sent to allow for notifications.,2021-02-22 20:14:21
Horrible experiences,False,1,bhumda,I absolutely hate this app. It’s very difficult to navigate. I received emails telling me that I have appointment visit notes available and then I get to the app and I can’t find the notes I’ve looked everywhere and nothing exists. Sometimes I receive an email saying that I had an appointment on such and such a date and that appointment never existed. Again I absolutely hate this application,2022-04-16 06:15:14
Pay Bill,False,1,Gary.B,"I’ve with Acton Medical in MA and the simple thing I’m trying to do is pay my bill. I cannot pay it through the App, and the payment section of the portal website won’t show all the fields on my iPhone 12 Pro Max to be able to see all the fields to enter the data to make my payment.

Can’t use the app,False,1,Mama MelE,"In the past, I have loved this app because I could access all my records with my doctor. However, a recent update is now trying to require me to set a passcode on my IPhone to use the app!! 
I have always had a passcode for the app, but I am not going to be controlled by an app to lock my entire phone with a passcode just to be able to use this app! 
One app is not going to dictate how I use my phone!!",2021-11-28 08:36:44
Needs improvement,False,2,Jerwan30,"With all the new technologies that are out the  app could use a major overhaul.  It would be extremely helpful to be able to link the app to apple health and to be used on the Apple Watch.  Especially since the watch can measure heart rates, oxygen, exercise etc and report it to your physicians.  Gives a whole new meaning to healthcare.",2021-10-29 11:11:41
Poor in most aspects,False,1,msheltra,Prepare to write text in a very limited fashion’s like no punctuation marks etc. and prepare to get logged out and then locked out or unable to login on a regular basis. Many doctors want you to sign in through portals and you have to use their application unfortunately instead of all of them getting together and using a universal portal you get this - a really poor choice of a software package for a doctors portal,2020-09-26 17:48:08
Can not login,False,1,Hanyusa2010,I just downloaded the app and every time I try to search my doctor with the three options available the search comes out blank page and even if I try the option that can’t find my doctor it also comes out blank so I can’t find my doctor to login even though I can login using google browser but the app doesn’t work at all. Please fix it ASAP,2020-05-15 10:39:31
"Ok, needs help",False,3,Hezmana ,"Initial login is very clunky, could be much more streamlined.  The app is very slow in accessing the data compared to logging in to a patient portal on a web browser.  In addition you really can’t do anything with the app but view data.  No ability to fill in forms/questionnaires.",2021-02-17 16:32:52
Developers could do better with this app,False,2,TimeWolf,I love the idea of this app but functionally it does little to help manage my health.  If you want limited reporting and communications with your health services Healow is for you. So much potential but delivers almost nothing.  There are hundreds of medical provider apps that will read data from an Apple Watch but not Healow.  I think this app has cut lots of corners and sold health care groups vaporware.,2019-10-30 15:26:40
Bad software,False,1,xtdr1,"I used the app on my old iPad , no problem. Just got a new iPad the app will not recognize my last name. Went to the company website couldn’t send e-mail. Tried to logon again , it said to verify me it will send me a text message, no text message ever sent requested again, no text. Tried a different way it said we will send  me an e-mail , no e-mail !

Incredible App!,False,5,Hendewerk,"I love the new app.  It is so easy to login, very intuitive to use.  Easy access to all my records. My lab and test results show up quickly and are easy to find.  Easy to email my doctor.  Love everything about it.",2017-10-21 10:36:06

Good start but needs a lot of patches,False,3,AM2188Health,I can’t see previous messages or reply to old ones. They disappear after being opened. I couldn’t refill my meds; the option isn’t available even though it says I should be able to.,2022-04-12 13:27:30
Housewife,False,1,JLauver2109,"I was told I needed to update my app, the app I have will no longer work. This is what I was told when I went to open my previous app so that I could order my meds. Now that I have downloaded the app I can not even open it, so now what I had on my previous app is lost. Not happy with this app at all. With times being like they are I’m needing to refill my prescription, and can not do so.

Not happy customer

Concerned user,False,4,horse gorilla,"Tried to use app for another doctors office. Could not find the section that lets me refer to the other practice. This makes it impossible to use for the new doctors office.
This review section won’t even allow me to send comments.",2020-06-13 00:54:38
Increasingly helpful,False,4,Skanky 007,The more I use this the more I like it. What I like most is being able to share lab results with other doctors as opposed to having to rely on an office sending them along for me. Kind of empowering. I am also able to track my results as needed.,2019-02-16 22:28:04
Punctuation not allowed???,False,1,shaeba88,"In trying to send an important email to my doctor the app would not allow it to be sent due to “special characters” within my email. I removed any parenthesis and italics but the error message continually appeared until I removed every single apostrophe, comma and period! What kind of app doesn’t allow ANY punctuation at all?? Thank s makes no sense!! It’s unacceptable and incredibly frustrating when trying to send a message!",2018-08-04 06:18:28
Ideal For Medical  Appointment,False,5,IslandBoyWeezy,This application made it easy for me to keep up with all my medical and dental appointments. Ever since I’ve been using this app I’ve made it to all my appointments and been keeping up with everything that’s going on with myself medically.,2018-05-16 04:28:14
Slightly useless,False,2,Joseph La Mere,"Why don’t you require providers to make all information available?  Only 2 fields are provided.  Not very useful.  I can’t even see my height and weight.  Contacting my provider won’t do much either, since there’s no request button, I have to talk to someone who has no idea how to fix it.  Would be four stars with these revisions.  Also why can’t you Touch ID to login?",2017-10-06 06:09:55
"Overall decent, needs integration",False,4,Razr7,Please keep us updated on plans to integrate to personal health profiles like Apple Health. It would be very helpful to be able to sync my data monitoring with my physician.  Especially with the current situation where remote appointments are needed.,2020-04-23 21:42:50
Very difficult to read,False,2,Oliver J Kat,"I like the layout of the website. I completely dislike the font size - way too small. Also colors of text on backgrounds. Small very light white on gray or blue background. Likewise, small blue text on white background. You have a good system, just a poorly designed usage of font size and color backgrounds.",2021-06-23 21:29:02
Nice concept ~ bad interface,False,1,Outdoor John,"I have 2 different medical providers and the app does not provide an easy process for adding the 2nd provider.  After logging into the  “default” or 1st provider set up there is not a clearly evident or easy way to set up a new different clinic.

The Healow designers should review the MyChart app to see how to design a better interface and an easy process for setting up additional providers.",2021-05-18 12:39:20
Needs updates,False,2,Whitelk,"While this app is convenient, it frequently does not work properly. It is very difficult to add other providers to your account. I use an iPhone 11 and find that the interface does not respond when I select buttons when trying to add new providers. For a medical app, this needs attention.",2021-02-22 20:14:45
Do The Developers IT people even READ these Reviews???,False,1,Lu$Lu,"It’s obvious no one is reading these reviews by everyone trying to use this app to navigate their doctor portals. 
If you read them you would be replying and fixing the issues so it is useable and user friendly. 
You should be able to search for Dr’s and get results. 
You should not have to have different
 sign -ins for each doctor portal. You be able to select between your different doctor portals under ONE sign-in. 
Life is hard enough these days. Why have an app that doesn’t work. 
It’s useless. 
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼Praying all the issues get addressed and fixed so Everyone can use this what would be a Wonderful app. ♥️♥️♥️",2020-11-03 05:11:02
Just ok so so,False,2,LadyAntler,"I appreciate having information at h  as bd and bring able to see current visits and test results, but cannot understand why I can’t update simple things like a dated of an illness or date of a surgery or my Drs phone number. 
I can’t even list prior surgeries that I’ve had done. Should be a place for that info as well from patient history other than just some Dr notes.",2020-04-16 16:55:26
Not showing results like it used to,False,2,StarletMoppert,When I want to check out my results to compare to the more recent results the screen is blank. It used to show them. Also it takes forever to load to see them when they did show. I’ve tried it on my iPhone and now I’m on my iPad and it still hasn’t improved. It did the same on my iPad. Yes I’m using a good WiFi.,2018-10-24 13:26:32
Many many functionality issues,False,1,Vt news reader,"Does not show “next” appointment correctly. 

Example. I have two appointments scheduled this week. On Monday. Tuesday’s appointment does not show in appointments. Nor past appointments. 
Friday’s appointment does show. 

Tuesday afternoon. After Tuesday’s appointment. It now shows in past appointments. And fridays appointment ( which was displayed until Tuesday afternoon ) is “missing”. 

However. The follow up appointment from Tuesday ( scheduled in December) that’s visible. 

Programmers are indexing from 0 and 1 and dropping records whey should be displaying. 

The support folks say use the website  cause the app has issues. 

Exactly what use is an app if you have to call the provider and wait on hold to verify accuracy of appointment info ????",2019-10-18 16:43:55
Send message,False,3,Will9578,"I just spent about 40 minutes trying to send a simple msg to my Doctor because it kept saying it wouldn’t accept a special character like an apostrophe.

Great Idea- Needs features,False,2,Bethery27,"It is a great idea to have a place where as a patient you can get all your medical activities.

Application Review,False,4,Daddyt52,"The app continues to improve with updates.

Keeps closing out! Please fix!,False,2,Beth 🦋,This app works great usually. Today it’s just asking for my passcode over and over again saying there’s been an error. I can’t use the app at all.

Healow is a huge help!,False,4,M-A 28,"I like having my last results at my fingertips, as well as next appt, Insurance info. Wish you could connect with my Physician also. Not sure if that is an app issue, or due to my dr office restrictions. Would like to view previous results also.",2019-02-20 23:38:26
No refills,False,1,Drybean1,You can look for hours and not find how to request a refill. This app is how the Doctor wants you to request a refill. True the pharmacy can request a refill but that request goes to the staff not the doctor. You could wait forever and not get your refill.  The app is a great idea but it seems the best way to request a refill is the old fashioned way...call the office during office hours. If they answer you’ll get your refill.,2018-12-26 08:57:56
Email editor needs work,False,3,Sailing Nomad,"It’s nice to be able to email your doctor. Unfortunately I couldn’t send that to my doctor because of the ‘ in the word it’s... the editor won’t take it.

Also it would be nice to send pictures as most doctors can see if a wound is healing correctly of if it might warrant an inspection in person.",2018-08-22 22:45:05
Health Kit integration needed,False,3,demockery,"The fact that this app doesn’t tie into IOS HealthKit data is the dumbest thing around. My dr. could easily have access to daily blood pressure, weight, pulse, you name it from the wealth of sensors in my watch and what I enter in. 

So instead I get to email screen shots or hold my phone up for them to read. Get with the program Healow.",2020-04-14 15:09:40
Very helpful,False,5,Lizzijb,I have enjoyed using the app.  I even added my family so I can keep track of their appointments too.  I can even set it to remind me of appointments.  I like how easily I can see results of tests or X-rays.  I recommend this app,2018-04-23 12:18:29
Crappy waste of time and collector of sensitive personal info,False,1,smommore,"Linking multiple docs is not easy or helpful. Date of most recent appointment went in as a 3 years ago event. Family linking is near impossible of course with HIPPA restrictions on child info despite the fact that children do not follow up on their own care at age 13 to 17. Managing multiple Healow accounts on a crappy app is no dream. Send me my reports via secure messaging please. Do not waste money on this sham, doc practices!",2017-12-12 00:55:29

Almost useless- at best,False,1,Chas271,"The overall font on iPhone is is very very small, with no option to enlarge it. Apparently the developers never tested their work.
Mail INBOX is available, but not SENT mail. Cannot refer to previous message to Dr, so you have to begin from the top AGAIN, trying not to forget what you sent the first time.(since last message not visible)
Very clunky to use overall",2021-05-08 16:17:56
Had web based experience and outdated everything,False,1,Petar ,"Calls it Touch ID despite being FaceID. Requires a lot of permissions to work for no good reason. Makes me question the privacy of this app. The UX is terrible. I wish my provider went with a different one. In fact, this might be a good reason to change providers, since I’m not really that satisfied with my current provider anyway.",2021-05-05 22:42:20
Garbage App,False,1,thefordz1,"This app is garbage. I was able to finally log in when I discovered my doctor’s office spelled my email address (user I’d) wrong when they set me up; however, when they corrected it and sent me a new user ID which is confirmed on Healow app when I follow those instructions, no matter what I enter as my password, it tells me invalid login credentials.

It’s areal pain in the A,False,2,DJ6220,Not very friendly to setup. No desktop or Windows app. Can’t contact support the they have questions set for you no place ask about your issues. Screen set for mobile phone and still remain horizontal no way to turn it vertical. Would be a nice app if cleaned up and medical users would update.,2021-05-15 13:39:24
Great app?,False,1,Scott Rider,"Terrible in terms of user friendly, not intuitive in the least. I was able to submit request for med refill after many attempts to do so. ‘Adding’ meds literally has multiple meanings in the app you guess which one you want.

CIMA Board of Directors,False,1,umsteadg,"How could you purchase such a low grade, low quality app?  Everything about it the look the feel and the content says I don’t care about my patients, I think as a patient we are worth more that this High School prototype of an app.   I got an email from CIMA telling me to go into the app and pay my bill.

OK,False,3,GrannyLittle,"So much easier if the appt reminder just came direct by email instead of email to go look at Healow.  So what?

Waste of time,False,1,Jeannette R.,"I was pretty sure I had this app but took for a long time to reset my password. It won’t let me add new names and keeps taking me to the same place over and over, even though I have 2 different pediatricians for my kids.

Worst app,False,1,JosephineSerescu,"I find it to be the worst app you can have to communicate through with the doctor..while outside US , you can open it but messages can’t be read.

Piece of crap,False,1,KayleighShine,I forgot my password. Easy enough to solve. Or it WOULD BE if this stupid app would recognize that I have changed my password but instead it just keeps insisting it’s not the right password even though I JUST CHANGED IT. So it wants me to change it again. Okay. Whatever. Different page this time so I’m like maybe it will work. WRONG. Put in a new password and click the log in “button” BUT WAIT. ITS NOT A REAL BUTTON AND WHEN I CLICK IT IT JUST HIGHLIGHTS THE WORDS LOG IN.,2020-01-18 19:25:46
Absolutely terrible,False,1,skmclau,I hate that I am forced to use this app in order to communicate with my doctors. It hardly ever works. The messaging concept is broken half the time. It doesn’t show the providers to even message the doctors. It runs so slow and doesn’t even load half the time. The notifications don’t even work so I never know when I get a message until I go into the app. This app is absolutely useless and I hate it.,2019-03-08 18:31:14
Difficult to Use For Multiple Accounts,False,1,Chlecl,"This app may work great for one user but having to manage multiple accounts (like for my kids) is extremely difficult.

It's still cellphone sized, even on the iPad. Really poor design.",2020-06-10 01:40:18
Well made app. Trackers are limited,False,3,Spacecadet77,"I like the app in general. Seems well built. However, there’s not enough support for devices. The list is fairly limited.

Half baked,False,2,Geevz,"A few major releases from now, this could be good. Messaging is probably 80% of the purpose, but this is very constrained. I hate to say it... it's faster to wrestle with the infernal automated telephones that almost all practices have.

There is no record of sent messages (really?) and no record that messages were received, so when a practice does not respond, where was the problem?",2017-09-14 14:32:18
Poor message design,False,3,Skhuss,"I’ve gotten a few messages from my doctor’s office, but I have to scroll ACROSS the screen to see the entire message.  There’s just one line of text that goes a really long way.  It’s a very difficult way to read a message.",2021-01-28 16:12:58
Worst app ever used,False,1,dhtuxu,Keep getting emails saying I got a message from my doctor. After login in it takes about 3 minutes for everything to come up then when I click on the message file it takes another 2 minute to open and then it says I don’t have any messages. Don’t know why I keep getting emails when I don’t have any messages.,2022-02-05 02:05:12
Working fine,False,4,ComicalMoodyDan,I was having issues with the app when I moved to iOS 15. It’s working fine now and the app works fine now. Could be laid out better but overall it’s a nice app that works.,2021-09-24 13:35:38
Nice App But It Forces Access To Phone,False,1,Christopher in Dallas,"I *can not* recommend this app. The Product Owner in their arrogance requires you to grant the app access to your phone’s microphone & camera for the “best” experience.

You do NOT have a choice I the matter.

If you do not grant access, the app can *not* be used.

It is *not* the place of any company to determine for me what I will and will not allow them access to on my phone.

It is *my* phone and not there’s.

If granting the access provides the “best” access, then I, the customer, should have the option to choose & decide for myself the experience that I want. If I want the less than “best” experience, that is my choice.

App deleted.",2021-05-16 15:34:53
Won’t even load past opening screen,False,1,KNHawk95,"I got this app for my GP’s office as they recently started using it. I can’t even get it to load past the initial page with the name on it.

Gets the job done,False,3,ChrissT1D,"The app is fair, but the messaging area could really use some work. I’m constantly having to re enter my pin when I’m mid message, and the special character restrictions in the text is absolutely maddening. Please, just let me type what I need and not have to go back to re-engineer my message.",2018-10-15 21:01:14
Healow app,False,2,prytanis,First it will not allow for you to add doctors after your initial set up. After that it wants you to log back in and then will not recognize your login information or it will give you an error message stating your login is already in use. The help section doesn’t help! Go figure! You can’t get most information on here anyway so what’s the purpose?,2019-06-10 22:44:00
Great App,False,4,AppleIsGettingOnMyLastNerve,"Very useful for reviewing appointments, medical records and sending notes to my doctor.  However one minor issue is that even though I can use it with my iPad, it does not rotate on the screen when I’m using my iPad with a keyboard.  Aside from that, I really do like this app.",2019-03-07 14:13:31
Why no special characters?,False,3,Travis Funk,"I LOVE this app and that I am able to communicate with our families doctors, but it’s kinda dumb that I had to go through and delete all of the apostrophes because they are an unacceptable special character. Inconvenient when you’re trying to send off a quick message.",2018-07-07 05:12:20
Great app to have,False,3,Nunya_1313,I would like to say this app is amazing and I am aware it does take time to fix bugs and broken links. What I seem to be finding is a problem with my account switching emails. It would be a lot easier to get things situated if I could actually speak to a person.,2020-01-29 05:27:13
Works for me,False,5,1cor141,The app works great! I like that it keeps track of everything in one app.  My records were available as soon as the doc had the results. No issues so far.,2017-06-13 11:31:23
Wonderful way to document labs,False,5,Yimmster,User friendly with a great interface! I can send messages to my doctor and have all my lab reports for review.,2022-05-12 13:03:36
Obnoxious,False,1,Rachelsbookreviews,"Only lets you open it when you put a pin on your phone. I do not want a pin on my phone. Don’t intrude on my personal choices. I hate this app. So when I use it I have to put a pin on my phone, enter my apple ID to confirm the pin, enter the pin to confirm the pin, enter the pin for the app, open the app, close the app, and then repeat the process to turn the pin off on my phone. Obnoxious.",2022-05-10 22:06:32
This app is a Nightmare!,False,1,Matlacha Hooker,"Doesn’t recognize me even though I am registered. When I attempt to sign it, the requests keep looping and repeatedly requesting name and birthdate.  No way to order prescriptions !  States provider (that they can never recognize) has not made Message Compose available. You therefore can NOT message for assistance.

Terrible app with limited to no support,False,1,mykh8*,"The on-boarding flow is buggy and broken for both the Healow mobile web and iOS apps. Not only am I unable to signup for an account which I need in order to obtain my rapid COVID test results, there is no support or help available for sign-up problems.

You broke it,False,1,Justanothercomplaint,This app worked pretty well until they “fixed” it yesterday.  Now I can’t do or see anything.  So I logged out— nothing.  Deleted and reinstalled and now it won’t even let me search my dr or login. I’ve had this app for years.  Please “fix” it so it works again.  It’s Very frustrating that this doesn’t work especially in today’s world and circumstances.,2020-05-15 13:12:19
Would be great with some improvements,False,3,uglymedic,It can be a bit tricky to use - especially trying to figure out how to request refills. I think it took me 20 minutes the first time I tried. Just needs some small improvements.,2022-05-04 19:57:43
Primitive/harassing reps,False,1,SNDNH,"I had a question about a payment on the account which they referred me back to my primary dr to fix.  I get it, their app is still kinda primitive, fine.  But then the consumer support reps kept emailing me asking why I wasn’t responding.  What other business is this aggressive? At first, I was trying to be nice and explained I didn’t really want the app anymore but they would not stop emailing me.  I had to flag them.  App deleted, never again!",2019-02-08 23:03:55
My prescriptions never seem to reach the pharmacy,False,1,MizATC,"So this app performs like hot garbage. The email function is difficult to use or understand. Changing information like pharmacy address and phone number is next to impossible.

Confusing, difficult, distracting are just some of the words to describe this. I am all for new technology but I’ll stick to using the phone going forward to communicate with my doctors.",2018-12-22 01:52:34
Worst app ever,False,1,Lynn46b,"This is the worst app I have ever used. I thought I paid the bill last month and I received another bill and I’ve been sitting here for over an hour trying to pay the bill and it keeps spinning and spinning. It says not to close the page or I may be paying twice. Evidently, I’m not paying it all.

Useful app.,False,4,hjrjjgjgkrym,"This is a useful app. I have two different providers who use it and it is a good tool to keep records, emails  etc together. The main complaint I have is it that it keeps uninstalling one of the practices and I have to keep adding it back.",2019-04-12 02:16:03
Zero Stars- horrible app,False,1,DCS1,"Never works or allow account set ups. I have two offices that use this app, thus I need to have two different providers on my account.

The most poorly designed app I use,False,1,Anditwassummer,"My doctor uses Healow so I message him via the app.  Can I check my sent messages?  Nope. No archive. You can’t even check that it sent correctly. Nothing more needs to be noted — if you can’t check your own writing, you aren't using a serious app.  I don’t get it?  Are there incentives for the docs because there are none for the user.",2022-04-12 02:15:51
Passcode,False,1,cpbuttercup2002,"Don’t force me to use a passcode on my devices in order to access my medical information on the app. which has a passcode to get into it already. I purposely don’t use a passcode on my devices and that’s my choice, not one you have the right to choose for me.

Kludgy and cumbersome,False,2,AppSeeker11,"Switched to new phone and had to start from scratch. Games can follow us from phone to phone.

"Great idea, but....",False,3,rebs_fan,"I love the idea of being able to access all of my care information in one place, but so far the only information available is my appointment schedule and lab corporate results.

Seems only to work with one doctor,False,3,JohnnyAngel69,"I have three doctors who subscribe to the service - my primary care doctor and two specialists.

Good app,False,5,Babe Larmer,"If you’re looking for a patient / Doctor app that works well this is it. Appointment, lab results, follow up messaging from your doctor, prescriptions, this is a great way to stay in touch with all those needs.",2018-05-02 13:08:02
Terrible connection issues,False,1,CMJPro226,"Neither the web site nor this app allow me to log in, as the web site gets hung up loading and the app says it can’t connect to the server, and this happens regardless of WiFi network or LTE, regardless of device, with no other problems with any other web site or app on either device I’m trying.

I love it!!!,False,5,Wonderboy67,"I can leave my Dr. little updates, make emergency appointments and even get feedback from my physician without being on hold forever.

I love this app!!!",2017-06-27 17:44:17
"Confusing interface, doesn’t sync with Apple Health",False,2,tboneh1,I’m not sure why an app would have such a confusing interface and then not sync with Apple Health Records.

"So slow, help/support doesn’t work",False,1,Katie B. C.,"I have two children, but I can’t figure out how to add both of them to the app. It can never find their doctors.

I miss our direct text messaging system with our doctors :(",2021-04-21 18:35:51
Hate this app,False,1,Chill white girl,"This app is not user friendly at all, it’s very confusing to use.

I can’t be the only one...,False,1,Renee Repik,"So far, this app has been a huge waste of space. I tried using the app to change an appt and never heard back from the doctor’s office. I’ve sent messages using the app only to never see a reply. Today was my breaking point - I received an email with my upcoming appointment information as well as directing me to use the Healow app. I open the app and the appt is nowhere to be found. This is insanity!!",2018-04-06 15:50:37

Useless,False,1,john q patient,"This app is really not setup to do much of anything. Although I can sign in, that is about all that is available.

A totally useless waste of time.",2022-04-16 21:35:33
Have not been able to get this app to function,False,1,SalROso,"Plain and simple, I get to where they ask you to agree to their terms and the app stops working with a message to try again later.

Essentially Useless,False,1,DeBlues44,"When signing into an app makes a computer literate individual feel as confused and frustrated as their 98 year old grandpa, there’s a problem.

Bad,False,1,lad557,Am trying to switch to a family account because both mine and my young son’s doctors use this app. It’s a pain.

Hard to use,False,1,Kimba0428,This app has so much potential but it’s not even easy to set up. My three-year-old is listed as the primary and I am listed as her child and my other two kids aren’t even on there. I cannot figure it out and can’t seem to get any help. This is not user-friendly in anyway and is completely impossible. Absolutely useless and I hate that it’s even connected to my office that I love.,2018-10-30 16:09:42
Works well enough,False,3,Lues R Lopez,"Works well enough to get basic information from/ to my doctor. However, i know its not being utilized to its full potential by my provider.

Sad little app with limited usefulness,False,1,raj.singh,Really not ready for prime time especially in the area of being able to share any health data recorded into Apple Health (regardless of source - Apple Watch or a 3rd party BP monitor or Bluetooth glucose measure device etc).

Not good,False,2,Onager12,"This app is infuriating.  You go through a variety of steps to link a practice, and that only works about 50% of the time.  Then it doesn’t remember who you are.

Horribly Designed and Non-Functional,False,1,ClassicCrime22,"The more I use this app the more I see its shortcomings.  I’m guessing that the group that designed and developed this didn’t do much to provide the basic features a user actually needs, but instead rushed to get it out to the world to meet some deadline.

A terrible app,False,1,Mark Ortom,"This app is so bad it is hard to imagine how any self-respecting IT professional could select it for us for their hospital or medical practice. 

For example, and just one example, the email creation process does not preserve paragraph breaks or offer any standard formatting tools. When my doctor receives my message it is just one big lump of text. One sentence after another without a paragraph break anywhere. Is this 1980??

I have actually avoided doctors that use this app.",2022-05-10 14:46:06
Worse than useless,False,1,Qgqgwtwv,"The app does none of the useful things like scheduling appointments or reviewing labs or paying bills.

Use to work perfect,False,1,justice4all!!,"Not sure what went wrong but I use to be able to read an entire message from my doctor in the messages. Now I can only read the first line.

Unable to communicate with provider,False,2,MommmaBird,I’ve tried and tried numerous ways to send a note to my provider and every time the system tells me he’s not found.

Don’t bother,False,1,Beerd ,"This Literally happened. When signing in for first time I got to a page that wanted me to agree to privacy conditions and there were no documents to view.

Functional at best,False,2,Ramster5678,"The login process is full of server side, ambiguous errors. Even after login, certain menu items will spontaneously generate error messages.

So many bugs,False,1,Life long mfp user,"my provider created an account with a temp password. Told me I’d set up a new one input some info, no big deal. Except the app keeps me stuck in this loop of resetting my password over and over. When it accepts the new one it takes you to login, it’s successful and goes back to the reset password screen. Kind of hard to use for telehealth when I can’t even get into the app.",2020-04-01 20:31:04
Easy and organized,False,5,thebambster,Best app ever all the information I need from the doctor is right there. So much easier to keep up with appointments and updates,2019-05-22 17:17:21
"A good start, but could use some improvements",False,2,mendelium,"I’ve been using this app for several years, and I am disappointed that the company behind it has not done a better job of improving its performance and reliability. Below are a few of the issues I experience:
 
1. Frequent crashes 
2. App reports that account is not attached to a provider
3. Inability to support multiple providers in a profile
4. Inability to book an appointment from the app (although that may be due to a provider’s limits, but I don’t know)

The web site works fine. Too bad the app cannot create a similar experience for us.",2019-03-08 22:40:45

Great app for my life,False,5,Dennis Grandinetti,I love being able to contact my doctor or seeing my medical records whenever I want.  Plus it’s easy to use and doesn’t require at rocket scientist to use.  Great app thumbs up.,2018-07-06 19:14:36

"Works well, needs TouchID/FaceID",False,3,tim.kite,"This app works quite well, which is more than can be said for most healthcare provider apps. Zero frustration...except the whole PIN thing.

Hard read,False,3,Undoist,I find it difficult to read the info on the app. The type size is tiny. That wouldn’t be a problem but it’s white on a light color background. Why make it so difficult?,2020-10-24 13:04:54

Plz fix this ASAP!!!",2021-03-01 13:38:52
Piece of junk,False,1,Vinrod,No way to request help. Try to verify who I am and it can’t send a verification text to my phone. It says my number is invalid. There is no customer service or number to request help. Why would anyone trust a company like this with sensitive information is beyond me. They either need to get smart or sued and go out of business. Either way USELESS APP!,2021-02-16 15:34:16
Design failure,False,2,Callie_dan,"This app is almost useless because of the poor GUI - extremely small type in message part, thin line type throughout makes it difficult to read, no home button? 
This needs to completely redesigned to make user friendly.",2021-01-24 21:07:11
It’s getting there...,False,3,Nmbr1Fanilow,"The idea to make the patient experience for virtual appointments and managing care is obvious with the features like medication, appointments, messaging, records, etc. The app user experience needs polishing and developing, though.

Terrible,False,1,robbbbbbbbbbb12123234,"I’ve spent the last 30 minutes trying to reset my password. The app kept saying “connection lost” before it took me to the reset page.

Cannot access my provider,False,1,WinkingBuddha,"After being kicked off and having trouble re-establishing my account. After several attempts to get password via email, went to text.  Finally got re-linked with my provider. 

But now unable to send a message. I’m in my provider account, but won’t allow me to send message on app and cannot find my doctor during search! And I’m in my doctor’s account. This is a vital health issue.

Also tried on-line. Even worse!

Only an on-line FAQ for help. 

Need this application. Hard to get a hold of the doctor otherwise. 

Please fix this. People’s health and even lives may depend upon this! This is Serious!",2019-01-06 18:17:49
Convenient but unreliable and a little confused,False,2,Markkgg,While generally good to get messages to doctors’ offices the responses are often difficult to read or repetitive.  In addition the application (and this is for the whole on line program) doesn’t handle multiple facilities using the program.  Continual lockouts.  Poor interface,2018-05-25 15:53:44
App needs improvement,False,2,Former team member,Look at some other healthcare provider apps to help you understand how it should work. Does not search for Doctors easily and freezes often. This app has potential but needs an overhaul 12 plus years old and it performs like it!,2022-05-05 00:04:49

Not good,False,1,johnflufin,"Confusing interface. Not very intuitive. For a medical app, this has surprisingly bad legibility issues - font too thin and small, not enough text contrast, text can’t be resized. My eyesight isn’t even that bad but I have issues making out some words and info.

Poor App terrible customer support,False,1,Maximum security,"This App is very poor - the web site is not any better.
 It does not allow special characters like parenthesis in messages. It crams results (written by doctors) into a narrow little column. It does not allow rotation to landscape mode. There are no phone numbers to contact support, all you get is emails with someone in India.",2021-08-12 14:47:55
Messaging needs improvement,False,3,busted100%,"The app is great, but I would like to be able to reply to a message rather than have to start all over with a new message. I’m sure it would help the provider too.",2020-07-20 15:22:25
Unsure: hard to use,False,3,kaynorris,I can log into the app but I can’t view future appointments and it’s hard to navigate like most health care stuff. This is the only app my physician uses. There are a lot of physicians with options there.,2022-04-19 18:11:27

Bad app or bad doctor?,False,2,Going back to PS VUE,Not sure if the app is bad or my doctor isn’t using it correctly. It is very frustrating using the app. Nothing seems to work correctly. I tried sending a message to my DR today and the app said I can’t use special characters such as “‘“. So I’m not allowed to use punctuation when communicating with my doctor?? Absurd.,2018-07-30 16:30:33
Dr Jantin Daas And Staff,False,5,TazzLPN,"I Love My Doctor And His Amazing Staff but this App is the Sprinkles on Top of the Icing!!

App demands 24/7 access to camera and microphone,False,1,Iphone_Dude9977,"I would love to use this app to check my medical records. However , the app demands 24/7 access to microphone and camera. In 2021 that is unacceptable. The app needs to allow the option not to access these. If and only if access is required for right now would I ever allow this.",2021-11-03 13:25:02
Health App Integration,False,1,Bevo MCMXVI,"Until Healow integrates with the iOS health eco-system it’s an inconvenient and disparate set of records that might as well reside in a paper folder. 

Useless for sharing or referencing comprehensive health data.  

Double the uselessness if your healthcare provider doesn’t use it - “online check/in” and then being handed a clip board when showing up at the office? Really?",2021-08-04 11:01:46
Crashing,False,3,bb134k,This app was amazing the first few times. Now this app seems to crash 20 minutes I have a television appointment. When I try on PC the loading takes about 20 minutes to finish vitals. Very unresponsive.,2020-11-20 15:36:30
Email reply not working,False,2,mc5703,"The App worked fine up until about a few weeks ago. Now when I try to open a email rely from my physician, the reply is just one continuous line of text not in a paragraph like it used to be. Hard to read.",2021-02-08 01:48:26

No iPad support,False,3,Laurie_scraps,"I use my iPad much, much more than my phone and although the app works on an iPad it’s only in portrait mode. It is a pain to have to turn my iPad to read the app. Please make an iPad version or allow landscape mode. Thank you.",2021-02-03 12:12:51
Worst health app available,False,1,Mike Rup,"The interface for mobile is poor, almost impossible to read. Implementation with my doctor has been difficult and plagued with stop/starts.

Privacy Concerns,False,1,JGandhi,"This app appears to REQUIRE that you grant full access to your iphone’s microphone and camera.  It also requires notifications to be turned on.  It will not let me register without granting access.  If I want to use these features, I will grant access to do so.  Privacy doesn’t appear to be a choice anymore.  Will not use this app.",2021-09-02 18:55:06
Poor participation by the medical practitioner,False,3,dpcacchiotti,It appears that the app could work well if the medical group would use it. We were asked 3 or more years ago to install the app. Without the medical group using the app it is useless.,2021-07-26 15:40:15

 No way to revise/adjust medications other than re-entering as new medication.

 Would also like my provider to have access to info from my iWatch such as afib info, ecg results and fall info.

Permission hungry junk,False,1,SquireCD,This app is awful. It does not need camera & microphone access but the app won’t let users login until permission is granted. The web app is terrible as well.

Healow>. As unusable as software can be,False,1,michael of vero,"Spent 40 minutes, wasted.  Next time to get med test files will just drive to doctor ‘s office.

Poor design and user interface,False,1,MamaWhoCares,"The pastel colors and microscopic print make this app not only hard to use but dangerous.

Needs BIG improvements,False,1,Pwom,"First time using and it doesn’t recognize my nurse practitioner. Put in a Dr. name and it wouldn’t let me choose the correct location of two even though it was displayed.

When you see it on the screen you see a message with a bunch of words cut out of the middle. There is NO indication that there are words that are cut off.

Easy enough to use but ...,False,3,bdafsc,"Easy enough to use when I remember my password. Sometimes I'd rather call the doctors' offices. When I get a warm receptionist on the phone who's willing to speak with you, it's a better interface than any app. Perhaps old school.",2017-08-29 02:30:40
Worst app,False,1,Kaandy916,I have a family of 4 I do not want to create log ins for each one of my children. If they have the same insurance and the parent takes care of their apts  why not have the children fall under a parent like every other app. If CVS Frys ans Walgreens can do it so can you!

No Apple Health Integration,False,1,TimP.,What is this?  Why are there so many options to integrate health information but the big ones are absent.

I hate this app,False,1,The7thBleu,Looks like it was made in the 80’s and not in a good way. The website is a nightmare and tech support is none existent.

No reply button,False,2,DRee1102,It’s highly annoying you can’t keep a chain of messages going because there’s no “reply” button. You have to create a whole new message every time!!! Annoying.,2022-03-14 20:44:18
Terrible App,False,1,River 44,With today’s technology this app seems to be about and act like it was developed in the late 80’s.

Doesn’t support Apple Watch,False,4,Blvdhollywood,My only complaint is that they allow you to add health tracking devices except Apple Watch. Other than that it’s a very helpful app!,2017-12-15 20:53:52
Basic Edit Function Needed,False,2,CAMtheAppleFan,I had to send a note to my provider and I could not because I had used an apostrophe in my text.

Needs to be Apple friendly,False,3,glendalemom,"It’s not a bad app but it doesn’t talk to Apple Health or Apple Wallet (vaccine records) or Apple Watch! It’s is 2021 and you were smart enough to make an Apple app, give it some connectivity to Apple products.",2021-11-04 03:57:42

Accomplishes the bare minimum,False,1,Jonaszcdfsgh,"The app is unintuitive. Worse, it has a tendency to be buggy around seeing responses from my provider. That would probably still be 3 stars.

Not updated so doesn’t work above OS14,False,1,KASHF,"The developers have not updated the app, so on iPhones running iOS 14 or above it says that the app cannot be opened because the phone is jailbroken (even though it is not).

The app has been Hacked,False,1,ComputerEngineerWith38yrs,"During my first install when I logged in to my provider the app required that I create a new PIN to unlock my phone.

Useless and Pointless,False,1,altF4UnInstall,"I was told about the app and started the whole reset password process but can never log in as it tells me the new password chosen is weak.

Garbage,False,1,Al Dente Nessaroni,This app I awful it so hard to communicate with my provider. I see a therapist for anxiety and having to use this app feel like some awful immersion therapy.

Doesn’t even work,False,1,Ksin33,"Unfortunately I downloaded this app for the sole purpose of being able to view my labs and results. But when I go to view them, all I get is a “loading” circle and it never loads. Disappointed that my provider uses this app.",2021-11-10 08:04:32

No option to log in,False,1,Klmyhv,"The app is useless. I can log on via the website, but the app Doesn’t even have the simple option to log on. I have to find my doctor as though I’m creating a new account. But according to the app my doctor  doesn’t exist. Waste of time.",2021-01-04 16:51:18
Total waste,False,1,Matt453374327,"As usual my doctor’s office has been really pushing this app for several years, and when I finally humored them and downloaded the app, the “simple” account setup was ludicrously complicated.

Unneeded block,False,1,EliteARO,"App seems great and does its job well, there is no reason to have any sort of device modification detection in this.

Only a PIN?,False,2,BaliThai,I downloaded this app and was surprised to see that it only needs a 4 digit PIN for access. For my health info.

Worst portal,False,2,12278659wtfpinterest,"I am on 4 doctor’s portals, this by far is the worst. 20 million $ a year for this?? This looks and runs like a program from the 80’s. 
Half, if not most of the time, parts of it (like messaging ) are down.
Messaging is antiquated, fonted in old school typewriter with unknown symbols before and after message. 
It does about half of what is available on my other portal’s. 
I filed a complaint with my health care provider. 
My provider is clearly getting ripped off!

Terrible,False,1,Nickr278,"This app is the sole platform for communication from my healthcare provider and I could not be less satisfied.

Useless App,False,1,Rickse,This app is useless. It is impossible to log into and I am tired of fighting it by continually resetting my password in the hope that it might work someday.

Not compatible with password managers,False,1,TechnoCritic,"The most irresponsible thing you can do as a developer nowadays is to release an app that does not allow you to paste IDs and credentials copied from a password manager, especially in the type of app where user login security is critical.

After 20 minutes of resets, doctor specific codes and pins sent to my phone, I just give up. I’m pretty sure I don’t have strep, I just was trying to make sure, but this isn’t worth it. I’d rather be sick than deal with this.",2019-08-19 13:11:21
Terrible App,False,1,Eks2,"Slow, Half the time can’t load messages. Can’t reply to a message, have to start a new one. Can’t use Face ID.

Very average,False,3,turtlepurple19,"The app and desktop versions are not as sleek or as intuitive as MyChart, for example. The fact that the app doesn’t accept ‘special characters’ like apostrophes in its messaging system is catastrophically annoying.",2018-06-09 21:11:51

So frustrating,False,1,zoe Merritt,"I can log in but any email I get sent that tells me to go to the portal to look at a message or a bill is pointless. The message never loads, there’s no place to view the billing statements and it’s just disappointing as a whole",2022-05-11 16:08:08
Worst app ever,False,1,babzeevee,"I have been trying for an hour to make some sense of this thing.

"Compared to My Chart, this app stinks!",False,1,Mimi471,"I wish this doc would switch to My Chart instead if this garbage.

Complete Junk,False,1,Lankylegs7071,If you have more than one doctor using this app save yourself some heartache and just call them. This app is a nightmare to setup more than one doctor. Their website is terrible on a mobile device. The app is terribly slow.,2020-12-16 23:37:02
Kinda bogus,False,1,Pumblow,I got testers recently and had to call planned parenthood for my results because no results were being show for April when I went in.

Doesn’t connect to Apple Health,False,2,daviesn,"This is close to useless without it connecting to Apple Health, which houses my workouts, weight and BMI from my scale, etc. That info would be extremely help to be linked with my doctor’s records.

Unreliable and error prone,False,1,San Antonio AC Guy,"Started out fine but as more practices are loaded, appointment functions are becoming more buggy.

New versions arrive with no info for consumer,False,3,johngameropa,"If you are a Patient who uses the app Healow then you are better than the entire class humanity. Using a Patient Portal app, Healow and MyChart, is what we all need to do for ourselves and those we help with their care. Demand your providers allow you to use the app Healow or MyChart so you don’t have to have one for each health system.

Previously I gave the app Healow one star. I’ve now given the app Healow 3 stars because it is the Doctors Offices who make decisions on how we use the apps. While they worry about their number of clicks they don’t worry about Patients number of clicks. Question them often and never accept them blaming the app maker or vendor website.

To eClinicalWorks and Healow teams keep up the good work. I am disappointed still in enhancements to the mobile app Healow. Practices will not tell us, will never tell us, what’s new in the app or website. It’s not their priority to think of us Patients.  Please create a space in the app, or a hyperlink in the app to the eClinicalWorks website where we can be informed about changes to the app or functionality. 

It is disrespectful to users to always put “Version Update x.y.Z - Fixes to bugs and enhancements.” Here on the App Store when there are updates and you do not provide what they are.

To Apple…I wish you would forbid such blanket statements like “…bug fixes and enhancements…” with zero info about the changes. Also health systems, like Nemours with their app, gave themselves 5 stars and then locked out any future reviews. That should not be allowed ever.  They have created a lie in the App Store.

Thank you all. - jga 12 Nov 2021

App does not allow special characters like the app MyChart. App gets no updates and no patient input allowed unlike Epic’s MyChart. - JGA —— Older Reviews —— App no longer works with iOS 14.3 on my iPhone11. Messages on initial view may or may not appear. The images displayed here in the App Store are NOT accurate and Apple needs to do something. - JGA — Previous Comment— Hello. It does not matter what I or others write here or assign as stars. The app Healow is what it is. Here are two issues with the app compared to the website workflows: - Cannot reply to Practice messages sent to me. I must do 10 to 13 taps to I recreate the message sent to me so the Providers are not negatively impacted trying to pull multiple patient messages together. Someone is going die because the app Healow did not allow a reply to a message. - No Apple Health connectivity. - And last...I have the Healow July 2018 App Users Guide.

Horrible App,False,1,mcspaul,"Everything within the app is horribly slow.  It frequently locks up while trying to load up the data from the section selected in the interface.  Their website seems to also suffer from this problem.  It is slow and pages lock up while loading data.

Messages from the doctor show up in small text at the bottom of the screen.  That is fine for short 1 sentence responses from the doctor but any longer message would be difficult to read.  Messages should be opened in a separate window, screen, or in some way separated from the rest of messages and also from the rest of the app.

What is the point of using an app instead of just a website/web portal if it does not take advantage of any of the hardware platform it is running on.  An example of this is the use of PIN codes for access.  Why not use the fingerprint reader (Touch ID on iOS) or facial recognition if the hardware supports it?

Scheduling an appointment is also much more difficult than it needs to be if your doctor is part of a large group.  When requesting an appointment it shows every doctor in the group not just your doctor.  That might not be so bad except that it only shows a small number of doctors at a time.  You then have to scroll down and let it load a small list of more doctors.  Having to constantly keep scrolling to the bottom, wait for it to load a small amount of doctors, and keep repeating this process until you find you doctor is slow and frankly irritating.  Also why are the doctors sorted alphabetically by first name.  Some doctors are referred to by their first name by patients but most are referred to by their last name.",2018-03-01 23:17:09

"Another so-so ""one stop"" portal solution",False,1,LucasHolt,"The interface/UX is *fine*, nothing more. Healow gets the job done (for the most part) but leaves a lot to be desired, especially given every doctor/hospital/practice/insurance provider pushes a different ""all-in-one"" portal destination app and even makes it more difficult for those who don't opt in. Some are better, some are much worse but none are great or offer solutions that would inspire me to refer friends to use it. It seems these apps are just rushed to market in order to check a ""product"" box vs. solve problems/streamline patients' care. 

Biggest issues so far: 
• All the alerts informing me of my appointment a week ago. Thanks, but I remember because I was physically there. No need to send an 'alert' 5 days after the appointment, especially if there are no necessary next steps/key details recapped in the summary. Alerts are for new info, not  rehashing memories. 
• Medical Docs: no feature to attach documents to messages within the portal... It's 2017, let's not reinvent the wheel in terms of basic communication needs. What's the point of if users have to use the portal only to then have to request email addresses from docs in order to (insecurely) transfer medical documents? This only adds extra steps and does nothing to expedite. 
• Security: TouchID exists, please include it in your next update. Get up to speed or PLEASE just get out of the App Store. Why download a clunky app if it offers the same experience as a low budget web-site?
• Messaging: the mobile app does not have a way to see sent messages or conversations in thread format. Instead you can only see messages you receive. As most users are not fluent in medical details, referencing back to earlier interactions/context from back and forth with medical staff is important.

Uselessly incomprehensible,False,1,Freeport Mainer,"The graphic design of the Healow iPhone app has rendered it entirely incomprehensible and nearly useless.  It is chock full of unlabelled, cryptic, infinitesimally small, hieroglyphic icons, utterly devoid of all meaning, unless you happen to have your Junior G-Man Secret Decoder Ring handy.  
So, if you’ve been asked to confirm your medical appointment, you go to Appointments, right?  But once you find your appointment, which one of the four icons are you supposed to click?  
So the first one sorta looks like a heart with a hole in the middle, but my appointment’s with a dermatologist and I’m pretty sure he doesn’t treat cardiology problems, so maybe this is a map pointer?  I don’t see how I can confirm my appointment by going to a map.  
The second icon has these tiny little rectangles with even smaller stuff inside each one.  (Why did I leave my electron microscope at home?)  Wait!  I’ve got it!  It’s so obvious!  It can’t be anything other than an Excel spreadsheet reduced to 0.003%!!!!
The next icon is unequivocally clear.  It’s a telephone.  Ok, so click here to call the office secretary to confirm your appointment.  So why didn’t they just say that in the email?  What’s the point of going to the app?
And I know what the last one is!  That icon is an eye!  That was easy, but what’s that supposed to mean?  “Your dermatologist wants you to stop wasting his time, because what you really need is an ophthalmologist!”  Or maybe you click the eye to have a video FaceTime call with the appointment secretary instead of a simple phone call?  Or maybe it’s the icon to confirm you’re ready to “see” the doctor at the appointed time?  Or maybe you click the eye to say you can’t make it to the office for a face-to-face visit, but you’d like to request a dermatological telehealth video examination, instead?  I give up!
I’ve seen LOTS of really BAD user interfaces, before, but, without exaggeration, this one may very well be the worst.  
Some UIs are ugly, some UIs are clunky, some UIs require an unnecessary string of multiple steps to accomplish what ought to be a simple one-click task, but I’ve never encountered one (even for complex highly technical applications) that was so impossible to understand.  
Granted, the graphic design looks pretty.  It’s got tons of uncluttered white space.  But if I want to see pretty design, I can go look at the annual AIGI awards.  The fundamental hallmark of good graphic design is clear communication.  This design is a hallmark of irritating failure.",2020-02-26 16:39:20

"Good tool, needs work",False,3,dlm3 in TX,"Overall I like Healow as a way to communicate with my doctor securely, seek an results, etc. 

That said, it leaves much to be desired. 

Four things stand out:

1) When editing a message, the insertion point can drop below the keyboard pane making it necessary to add return characters to get the last line of text in view. The editing window needs to be limited to the active area, not including the keyboard space. 

2) a new ""feature"" limits the number of characters of a message that can be viewed on the app, with no option to open the full message, forcing me to go to the online portal. This is unhelpful and needs to be addressed ASAP. 

3) there is no way to see the messages I send to my doctor. I should be able to see and reply to an entire message thread. 

4) TouchID. The current verification method is ok but TouchID is more secure. With this becoming more commonplace, it should be an obvious enhancement in the near future. 

Oh. And a full featured iPad App that isn't a rehash of the portal would be valuable. The phone app is convenient but an iPad app is less confined and gives opportunities for better communication and viewing data.",2016-01-04 16:17:04

Waste of Time,False,1,PrincessPunzee,"This app has yet to work in several months. Somehow I was signed out of my account, but it still has certain pieces of information from that provider. When I try doing a search to locate my provider and sign back in, it gives me a field to type in a name, but that field will then disappear and switch to a different field! Once I get past that madness, I have to login. Of course, I didn't remember my login or password. First I asked the app to send me my password via text, and it's been 20 minutes and I still haven't received a text. I then requested it by email and received it immediately. Then I tried logging in. Let me go back a bit to explain that with each password attempt, the screen performed the classic ""loading please wait"" gesture and quickly ended with me still looking at the login screen. I thought it was because my password attempts were wrong, but the screen didn't say that either. After resetting the password and successfully entering it, the system STILL did not recognize I was trying to login. Until now, I am still unable to access my account through this app. I would like them to take another look at what's going on with this app because it's completely useless to me except for to look up the 2 One-time doses of medication I received two years ago from what looks like an unknown source (since I still can't login to my providers account and it doesn't give that information with what I currently can't see).",2017-03-16 14:33:46
Horrible Software and Support,False,1,SMTIPS,"My doctor uses the software from Healow, that has gross mis-formatting in their appointment reminder emails. It seems that it's more important for the software maker to have a big banner ad for themselves at the bottom of the emails than the appointment reminder text to be correctly formatted (the entire line that the address, location, and time is on has no spaces at all, it looks sorely stupid).
I emailed Healow to tell them I'm concerned that the emails sent look so unprofessional as to be laughable. The response was a curt, rude answer that they only make the software and that they don't control how people use it and I should call my doctor's office...yet half the email is an ad from them! And yes, it sends a callback to the software company via the graphic load in the email. Obviously they’re more interested in advertising than in providing a decent software or training the staff on how to properly use the tool. I bet they are soaking doctors for a bundle, and the sad part is, that most (probly 99%) recipients won't ever let anyone know how unprofessional it makes the doctor look.",2014-08-01 21:42:18
Password disaster u-turn,False,4,umitislo,"I have had an issue with the password retrieval for almost 3 weeks, the link kept saying 'expired' and when I tried to update it online, I wasn't able to save it. The reason to retrieve my password was because my doctors group screwed up my account by messing up the doctor, they changed it to referral stating that I shouldn't be using this app to get in touch with my doctor. But in reality up until they changed it, I would ask a question and it would be emailed to my child's doctor, and she would respond to it within 2-3 hours. It was working perfectly. Watch out Children's Medical Group, I hope you learned your lesson not to screw up patients accounts!
Thank you Healow, your experts solved my problem. I'm back on! My notes are gone but I can see the doctors notes.

Wonderful & Easy to use!,False,5,Tanner063011,"I have been using this user friendly app for over a year and love it.

Also, I can also see my next scheduled appointment or schedule a new time as needed.

When I was away this last summer I had a medical problem. Through this app I was able to let my physician know what was happening via the email portion. I was given directions for my care very quickly. So much better than playing the telephone tag game! The app provides faster access to my medical caregiver.

In the event I need to go to the ER or another physician not on the same system, I have a list of my medications, lab work and diagnosis from my primary physician. 

I will continue to show this app to my friends (it's very impressive!) and other medical professionals I visit.

I would like to recognize a job well done to the good people of eClinical Works who designed such an easy to use product. Thank you for making my life just a little easier to manage.

Piece of Junk,False,1,phsshpphs,"Just look at the first screen shot.  Light blue on white lettering.  Impossible to read.

I had tried it on a Nokia 635 running Windows 8.1.  I figured the app was junk on Windows Phone because nobody pays any attention to it, so I tried it on my iPhone 4s.

When a company supposedly interested in people's health can't figure out the importance of contrast in a user interface, they aren't going to last long.  I hope my doctor figures this out soon.  Usually I root for the underdog, but if this is the best eClinicalWorks can do then I can't wait until one of the portal behemoths swallows them.

I sure wish the consolidation of health portal technology would accelerate, either through mergers or use of standards.  I hate having to manage separate portals for every doctor.   Especially since none of them share information or use single sign on.  They have made patient service worse than it was before there were lame attempts at online health patient services.

At least, in the old days,  I could spend half an hour holding on the phone, ask my two sentence question, and wait seven days to get what I asked for in the mail.  Total time wasted, 35 minutes.  Now I get to bounce between portals trying to figure out where those pesky lab results ended up, then manually consolidate them because there is no interoperabity.

Sigh.",2015-11-07 00:38:28
Overall a good overview app for medical,False,4,Fjsheppard1971,"What I would like to see changed is the character field for messages from my physician.  Right now I cannot see the entire message without logging into the portal on my computer.  I would like to be able to either scroll the entire message or you add a unlimited characters to the message field so the entire message can be viewed. Over all it is a decent app.  It needs a few tweaks here and there.  I also cannot edit personal info like phone numbers from the app like I can when i log onto my computer.  I do like the pin creation to be prompted doe a pin.  It would be nice if the Pin was more more than four characters to make it more complex, but I am happy about the added security layer.",2015-12-29 23:09:17
Very happy,False,5,beanz206,"Saw a healow flyer in my doctor's office and decided to give this app a try. All I can say is wow! The appointment booking feature has made my life so much easier. I have to see my doctor a few times a year for my condition and I usually have so much trouble getting an appt booked (especially with an uncooperative front office staff). Now I never have to wait in line after my appointment to book the next one and can do it on my phone in a few seconds. I was a little skeptical at first with some of the reviews, but it does exactly what it says it does. Sure, a few improvements could be made, but many were addressed in the latest update and for that reason: 5 stars",2016-08-15 22:12:32
Has Potential But Disappointing,False,1,K-HAWKER,"I tried this app because my cardiologist uses the software.  It's a great idea and the description makes one think it is just what you want.  Apparently there is no support staff for the app.    I can't sync with my Fitbit Charge HR.  It does not connect with the Microsoft Health Vault or the MS band.  It does not connect to MyFitnesPal, GARMIN Connect or Apple Health.  Connectivity is everything for an app that is supposed to save you time by avoiding entering data by hand.  Signing up the medical professionals is great but that is only half of the picture.  The patients need to be addressed also. People are not going to drag a laptop to the doctors office when they have a $600 smartphone in their pocket and they are not going to key fitness data when they have Bluetooth fitness trackers.  Hopefully the owners of this system will get with the program, make a lot of improvements and this will become a ""go to"" app.",2015-03-24 02:57:50
Pathetic Application,False,1,WalkTester,"This goes from bad to worse.  After 5 days back and forth on email the app finally asked me to set a PIN.  I entered a 4 digit PIN and that was all I could do.  It did not accept it or open up any other avenue of choice.  I could backspace or type over the entered digits.  I tried scrolling down, up left, right - nothing hidden out of sight just stuck there.  I closed it.  Now a day later I tapped the app and I get the same screen but with the addition of Forgot pin, and Incorrect PIN once I had entered the PIN,  had tried so hard to register the previous day.  The screen wobbled and said I had an incorrect PIN.  I tried several times but always incorrect!  Next I tried the ""Forgot pin""   option.  It suggested I go to my patient portal and retrieve the PIN there.  As I've never entered or been asked for a PIN in my patient portal, not surprisingly it has no record of one. Hopeless!",2014-09-09 14:30:30
Works well enough for me,False,3,Pjcthoth,"I haven't had the password issues other users have brought up.  I popped up once and I just sat on hold with Dr office provider for 20 minutes to get it fixed. 
Overall, I get a much faster response from my Dr and/or his nurse than I do from calling. I do have to be VERY clear on my questions or I sometimes get weird responses but that is true of all written communication. 
The app does collect what meds I take well in additional to collecting all lab results.  I had to go to the ER 4 weeks ago (I was in terrible pain from chronic Pancreatitis) and I simply logged in this app and gave it to the nurse and Doctor and they got my meds, my history and any recent labs - boom - done! Then they can get to treating you!!!!",2016-05-07 18:15:10
"So near, yet so far",False,3,MAC353535,"Certainly the app is better than the previous method of contact the doctor's office; however, there are still some major items missing.  First, there is no history of emails sent.  Second, there is no way to get notification that emails are waiting to be read (I do not look at this app on a regular basis, so getting a notification sent to my personal email address that a ""message is waiting"" would be a terrific feature!).  Finally, if there was a way to store medical history and doctor's notes, the site would be much more useful.",2017-01-04 22:03:04
Decent app!,False,4,TobeyNator,"The app is a great companion to our pediatrician's patient portal- however, its usefulness depends on what information the pediatrician makes available. For example, for one of our children we can see stats like weight and height and for the other child we can't. 
There's some room for improvement- navigation is awkward in the My Records section- a summary/consolidated information section would be nice in order to reduce the number of taps it takes to get to certain information. 
The switching between multiple children should be possible from anywhere in the app without having to return to the home screen.",2013-06-15 15:16:17
This tool is exactly what I needed!,False,5,Rick Hankins,"I was shocked to see so much  dissatisfaction in a great app.  E-clinical is a PC software that houses your records for you to peruse whenever.  Healow takes the data from E-clinical and organizes it into their streamlined interface.  For example, when I had a physical this week, I told the nurse that I was now taking a new non-prescription 'drug'. I gave her the name and when she put it in her system, it appeared in Healow within minutes.  There are so many other advantages, but the best for me is that I always carry around MY medical record just  I'm case there is an emergency.",2014-01-24 17:03:16
No Problem,False,5,PJMtLemmon,"Not sure why there would be any complaining about this app. It took me 94 seconds to download the app. It took about 110 seconds to sign in and confirm my appointment time for tomorrow! I have used the web based portal and did know my user login.... This app will be perfect for my needs, checking test results (having them available for future comparative reference) and looking up future appointments, I always make the appointments 3 to 6 months in advance and can never remember when that future date is.",2014-01-06 06:19:25
Adding a Tracker - Fitbit Blaze not supported,False,2,Mack10161964,"I wanted to add my Fitbit Blaze to the app. However when I logged into the Fitbit app, I got an error message: The app your trying to connect did not provie valid informaton to Fitbit. Please report this issue to them. 
I would like to add this this health app but cannot connect it. Also, I noticed that you do not have any devices that are included in the Activity section. Since the Blaze and Surge definately have the capability to track specific activities, I am surprised that you have nothing in that category. I don't like the fact that there is an error in setting up my Fitbit Blaze (not an option in your list of devices). The app is not keeping up with the newer trackers availabe from Fitbit.",2016-07-25 03:41:13
What a disaster,False,1,VanillaShake,"If all you need is to read secure messages from your doctor, then sure -- the app will be useful for you. But for the remaining 90% of the advertised features, it's a joke. Activity tracking is completely non-functional. I have several Withings devices plus an Apple Watch and a Misfit. The app doesn't use HealthKit so it doesn't track the vast amount of activity information available from the iPhone M7, or the Apple Watch. And although I linked it to my Withings account, this app has yet to register any activity from those Withings devices. 

It would seem that most of the app is web-based, not native iOS. It's very slow to navigate and looks clunky. In all its not a good user experience and its issues are too annoying for me.",2015-08-12 14:17:17
Extremely clunky .. Broken password validation,False,2,Firepoet,"When first setting up an account the app asks for your original password and dob or phone number. Using a password database this process is literally impossible. I need to go back and forth between apps to generate an extremely secure password using LastPass. At the end of the three screen process the app says my randomly generated 18 character password with letters numbers and special characters is too weak. So I go try and figure out what its pattern is. Trouble is.. Each time I try I have to go back to the beginning. I still haven't figured out the pattern it wants.

So I gave up trying to use the app. What a terrible experience!",2016-05-01 12:07:11
Better messages option,False,3,Ichabodguppy,"I love the app- until I get a message back from the dr. It won't show the whole message and won't allow me to reply- I have to log in to the website.... Which begs the question of why I need an app if I have to log in anyway? If these issues could be resolved it would make the app so much easier to use, especially as a mom of several kids! I have all our accounts linked to my app- but again, I still have to log in separately on the website to view entire message or respond.",2016-03-11 22:04:48
Rx List,False,4,HCProxy1,"I have been using the healow app for some time now but I recently linked my mother's Ecw patient portal to my account. My mother is older and I did this to keep an eye on her healthcare and to communicate with her provider. I absolutely love that I can upload her Rxs here. I took pictures of each medication, added the dosage and frequency, and even set up cell phone reminders for when she needs to take her medication. This has kept her medications straight for over a month now and has greatly reduced confusion. Thank you ECW and keep making cool features for this app!",2015-08-12 20:05:21
Works Great!,False,5,Texas Liz,"Not sure why others have problems with this app. In regard to developing a PIN, you type in your 4 numbers; the system has you retype to confirm; you're good to go. You don't have to press enter or anything; the system recognizes you've input 4 numbers. I did cross reference my personal/medical info between the website and the app; it was accurate. If I ever change doctors, it's good to have this app as a quick reference of office visits, meds, immunizations, etc. For me, this is a great app!",2014-08-22 19:27:38
Helpful & Enlightening!,False,4,KatNewby,"I really like this app! Most importantly it keeps a record of my future doctor appointment dates, as well as past appointment dates. I also enjoy that when I have labs taken (personally, blood lab & x-ray) it keeps a record of the clinical results. I feel that in the future there may be ways to make the app even more beneficial to health conscious patients. It currently keeps a history of medications & dosages taken. With some creative thinking & ingenuity to broaden & enhance this app, it could become a mainstay app in most patients phones!",2017-01-18 12:17:38
Lab report function is junk,False,1,The Cleric,"Healow offers you access to your medical lab results, which is great. Unfortunately, a lot of those results (including the titles of lab tests) are truncated (resulting in names or results ending in ""..."").  There's no way to simply read the full text of the lab report. A lot of valuable data (like when the lab was actually collected) are in the report, but are unavailable from Healow, simply because of the developers' stupidity. 

The overall interface, with a circle of buttons reminiscent of an old iPod, is unnecessarily confusing and wastes screen space to no purpose. 

The interface for typing messages to a doctor's office does not use the standard iPhone keyboard mechanism, and therefore doesn't have the iPhone's standard autocorrect and word suggestion mechanisms. 

This app was put together either by someone who thought he was a lot smarter than he actually is, or someone who was paid by the hour. Either way, it's a lousy implementation of something that could be really useful.",2016-08-19 15:24:20
If you can't login hang in there,False,5,LadyArren,If you are having problems logging in to your portal or finding you provider's office don't  give up yet. Notify your practice that you are having problems.  There is some setup that they need to do and they may need to log a support ticket with eCW to correct their practice listing.  They might also be on an older version of the portal and need to upgrade.  DO NOT GIVE UP!!!  This app is only going to get better!,2013-03-14 12:22:06
worst app and worst support,False,1,Cheers456,"Healow cross references your doctors so you could get an email from a doctor which says from another doctor. if you have several accounts with HEalow it gets worse.
Now as for their support, it is ridiculously bad. They  want YOU to do the investigating. They can't be bothered, it seems. They always respond problem is going to upper level IT but when they reply it is just the same old , tired message----see your doctor.
in short, a mixed up, crazy system. If your doctor has it I would rather pick up a phone or do a fax to get info. Yes, the app reminds you of appointments but you can do same with a cwall or computer calendar.",2016-10-14 22:23:15
Pretty useful,False,4,American Shorthair,"Don't know why so many people are ripping this app. Used it for the first time today to send BP readings via message and received a reply from doctor same afternoon. That's progress. I can see all the notes from my previous appts. Not all info is available, like my recent lab results but I'm guessing that's less the app's fault and more the practice's fault. 
Bottom line - pretty good and I actually like the interface.

The four digit PIN you have to set up does not allow the fourth digit to be input, then it crashes and burns.  No workaround that I could determine.  a message tells you to go to the Patient Portal to reset your PIN, but I could not find that function.  The app is now deleted and I resent the amount of time I spent downloading and trying to set it up.  This app should be removed from the App Store until it is fixed.

Needs work-stick with web portal,False,2,Sandipez,"Besides their back end needing performance enhancements they need to deal with the bug with the pin. I got snagged with it as well. Had to uninstall the app then reinstall to get it to work. Then, if you click the ""forgot my pin"" link it just says to login to the web portal to see the pin. But unless the app actually registered the pin you will never see it on the portal! And why can't I change my insurance info? And refill request are buried under the medication's + button. 

App needs definite UI enhancements and better exception handling. Maybe QA it by someone besides the devs?",2013-09-26 01:49:47

My only use will be once a year lab results which I can get through dr's website at same speed.  Also tried to link iwatch as others said won't work. Is this a buy a Fitbit in disguise app?

But I constantly get ""the device is out of sync"" and have to login multiple times every time I try to do something new. Simple functions like ""compose new message"" are beyond difficult to find, and the server is constantly down so I can't even use the app half the time.

App is good-need to integrate with Apple Health,False,3,NewiOS Fan,"The functionality of the app is nice and I have had no issues like others have (maybe the issues are on the end of their doctor's office?).
What would make this complete would be integration with the Apple Health app so all of my data from the doctor, my fitness app and any other health related info is in one central location. My Healow info is the only thing I can't get in Apple Health....it's my data on my health, I should be able to get it where I'd like it!!!",2017-01-18 14:48:37
What a pain!!!,False,1,xx_VH_xx,"Horrible UI design. Very counter intuitive. As an app developer, I hate it when I see apps that were not designed with the user in mind.
Example: you have a person icon on top left. I would think that would show me all the people I have hooked to the app. But no. It shows me the ONE person who I have currently selected. How is that useful? In my case it was confusing and made me think I did NOT link the others correctly. Bad UI design 

  And errors like: ""We see there is some data mismatch between the accounts you are trying to link. "". That's... Useless. How does that error help me know what's wrong. Could you be more vague?",2016-04-11 22:29:36

Also, the app is not reliable. Sometimes the info shows, sometimes it doesn't. Tech support is unhelpful as I only get a stock email asking of its fixed. Nope!
Why isn't what's on the portal the same as this app? This is poor technology by today's standards. Let's get the basics right before going any further.",2016-03-17 17:48:44

Works really well,False,4,FloridaTrish,I just downloaded this app to send a note to my provider. Setup was effortless and the portal opened immediately with all options available.

The app repeatedly asks that I connect with my doctor's office even though I have already done that. And, yes, this is after logging in with a correct PIN, user name, and password. 
I can see that one doctor's office left messages, but I can't get any to open. 
The pen-like icon, which probably should be for writing to a doctor, does not work. 

Being able to contact my doctor and able to get messages from my doctor are important. 
I am not evaluating any other functions on this app because they do not matter. Get the essentials right.",2016-01-13 01:39:10
Can NEVER log in- not synched to portal,False,1,BarrMed,"I have never been able to use this, even after multiple attempts (and there is no real tech support). The web portal works (and shows that the app can be downloaded), but after doing so, they do not synch and basically the app does not work because it is impossible to log into. The doctor’s office is also frustrated because they do not know how to help. A total waste of time and effort to try and use this thing without tech support to assist setting it up and helping with synch to regular web portal site. Ancient software.",2015-03-02 02:52:32
App,False,2,Kaeden68,Too difficult to add multiple doctors in the app within the Roper Saint Francis system. After I added one doctor it was impossible to add another doctor within the rapper system using either their name or numbers in digits system. When it works it's great for keeping me updated on my appointments and that's about it. There should be a way for me to press send a doctors name and push add once I'm in my own account. When I asked questions on this no one seems to know what I'm even talking about. No what ever department I ask.,2017-04-18 02:44:52
Love this app,False,5,Olirho,I also have not had problems. I love having easy access to my current medications and allergies especially when seeing a specialist or new provider. I don't have to keep a list with me but can look it up with this app. I also love the med reminders. It integrates well with my calendar and I find it easy to use!,2013-09-01 13:55:34
Very covenient,False,4,Perfect14U,This app seems to be extremely convenient! When I have a appointment schedule I can cancel or check it from this app. I have my automatic reminders for all the meds I take set up and I get notified through text tones when it's time. There is my personal information and doctor set up along with many other convenient things I love. I could not do without this app,2014-04-09 19:59:11
Worthless,False,1,rejectseverynickname,"Worst. app. ever. I can go around in circles in a flowchart loop and have never been able to get a message to my doctor. I give up. It is a  useless piece of crap and the ""help"" bar is no help at all. No number to call, No chat help. I have this app loaded on both my phone and my computer. cannot even get to the patient portal unless I open an email 'from' my doctor but it won't let me send anything .Heck, it can't even find my doctor. I put it her name and it says no results. It's easier to walk to my doctors office and leave a post- it note in her mail slot!!!",2017-04-15 22:34:36
Undecided,False,3,DGirlinTX,"I just downloaded the app. Jury is still out for me on usable features that matter...appointments, results, etc. One area that stands out for me is Trackers. It would be incredibly helpful for this app to talk with Apple's Health app, or even some of the bigger app service providers, Withings, Fitbit, etc., so that health, exercise/activity, diet data, whatever all is tracked in Healow could be uploaded directly into the app. Who wants to have to do all that mess manually? Not me.",2015-02-18 04:22:37
Buggy junk,False,1,<[WillPower]>,"This program is effectively useless. I was able to log in once but I was unable to view my messages. The next time I tried to log in I was asked for my pin and I gave it. The program went to the main screen briefly then back to the screen asking for the pin. I entered it correctly over a dozen times with exactly the same result. I know I'm entering the correct pin. If I try another pin the field moves side to side a few times and ""invalid pin"" is displayed in red. It's a good thing the web version works because this is garbage.",2016-08-15 11:50:06
HEALOW,False,5,Doc Block in Florida,"Nice App. Easy to use. PIN function for log-in much simpler, quicker, & easier to remember than the full user name & password necessary for the web based version of the portal.  Links in App make it easy to find the info you are looking for, and the medical data is all easy to read on my iPhone screen. Overall, very well done.",2013-04-20 22:39:24
Good but needs improvement,False,4,jeffb63,"Biggest thing is that menu be more navigation friendly leaving messages for doctors and making sure they were received. There is no notification of last message sent and that it is being viewed by office. Another is achieving all of my doctors on Healow, not 3 other patient portal services to contact my different physicians.",2017-03-03 13:39:43
Limited to iphone,False,1,Ol' JT,"Thought that this would be a great app for my ipad, but it's limited to iphone.  Things like lab results are just too detailed to fit cleanly and clearly on an iphone screen.  I am a senior and unfortunately I have to see more than one physician and they  are not in the same practice/clinic   I thought it would be neat to quickly and easily access specific information and read it easily on an ipad.  I'm sure not about to get an 6 Plus just for the larger screen and I'm not sure how much better it would be anyway",2015-10-12 20:59:09
Terrible User Experience,False,1,bmnave,"This app constantly tells me that the “device is out of sync because of changes on another device” and asks me to login again, even though I just logged in and I don’t use the app on ANY other device.  Overall, the user experience is terrible.  I’ve tried multiple times to “Link New Account” and it keeps forgetting the account as soon as I close the app.  I’d use another app if this wasn’t the app that my child’s pediatrician uses.  I guess there’s always the web based portal instead.",2015-12-17 15:47:04
Yep. Waste of time,False,1,Mercergirl,"I don't have time to tell you how many ways this app fails. If you have multiple doctors using it, it is very confusing.  Only a form field truncated list of diagnoses (personal history of other malig....). Say what? I have what? Is that malignancy? 

That being said, it is a beginning, but apparently these developers haven't moved past the beginning in several years. Use the web site (which isn't much better).

Doctors, don't waste your practice $$ on this app. Patients, don't download it unless you just want to be frustrated.",2017-04-15 10:55:38
Amazing app!,False,4,Prince of Boston,"Love the latest updates. Use it to track my health information. from my doctor and my 10 month old son's immunization schedule from his pediatrician! Easy to get med refills and ask for appointments, no more endless waiting on phones. Highly recommended Holliston Pediatrics because they are truly 24*7 available with the app to address concerns about my son!",2016-07-08 14:34:40
Promised email is never sent.,False,1,copeworks,"I have attempted to use Healow on three occasions.  Having forgotten either the user name or password, I have never been able to access my account after I established it.  Sure, I should have written it down; I should have done a lot of things!  Healow has no support, and I suppose I have to go through the phone tree and the wait at my cardiologist’s office; the last thing they have time for is tech support.  I wish they would change portal servers because I benefit from all our other medical portals.",2016-01-31 01:23:26
"Sending message crashed & no ""Sent"" folder",False,3,JReeder2000,"Love the design of the app but sending a message to my doctor caused the app to crash.  And since there is not any ""Sent"" folder I just went to the desktop Portal.  There, you can Refill Prescriptions.  But, Refill requests don't get a sent copy.  If you could Refill prescriptions and see copies of Sent messages including Refill Requests, then, this would be a great app.  Please add these features.",2014-06-07 17:04:13
Nice app,False,5,Matthewg47,"The idea of this app is great.I like the fact that I will be able to 
Link my portal account my husbands and my kids  in one location. Being on an app makes it much easier to use . And way more convenient! Good job on listening to the consumers ecw ! Once the issues are worked out this will be awesome!",2013-02-15 18:19:03
Okay – For One Account,False,3,Dave240,"Works fine for one account. But after I added an account for my spouse, when I try to log in using her button, the program crashes and will not work again without restarting my iPhone 5S. For me, this is a serious fault, especially since one of the advertised features is that you can create accounts for all of your family members.",2014-01-30 16:24:22
Can't open messages or link multiple doctors,False,1,Frank the Parrot,I downloaded this app because my primary doctor emails me through this portal. I thought the app would help me better manage the messages I'm getting from my doctor. However with this app you can only see that you have a message I'm unable to open the message or send a new message. Also I got an error message when trying to link to a second doctor. The message gives no information on what to do to correct the problem.,2014-10-21 13:58:15
Handy; email is crap,False,3,Main-R,"I really like that I can find my appointments, and my medications list. I am very dissatisfied with the email in this app. I am an I-OS user and the email just doesn't work. I tried to email my physician on numerous occasions. Her email address doesn't appear so I can only send a general message. I dislike this, so have ceased using Healow app to connect with my provider electronically. I call the office and leave a message.",2017-01-24 23:42:59
Works great,False,5,Tdbenton,Does everything I need it to. Linked with my online account all my health records are in my hands when I need them. I think with this app and others it would be nice if they could scan your phone bypassing any pass codes to get to your records and meds in case of emergency .,2017-01-19 13:07:18
"Great concept, terrible execution",False,2,mk8isgr8,This app is terrible but it could be amazing!! I gave it 2 stars bc I love the concept and it has been a convenient way to communicate with my doc WHEN IT WORKS! There have been some messages that mysteriously get lost in the abyss. Its hard to read test results and you should be able to view messages you have sent to your doctor easier. The whole UI needs a major overhaul - I am going to hold out hope the app improves!!,2017-01-04 17:41:04
A terrible App,False,1,Rosminko,"After several attempts to link my accounts at different doctors offices, I am frustrated and disgusted. After several emails to customer support, I have been given the same generic saved replies and I am still unable to link my accounts. I keep getting the same message about demographic info being different and yet everything reads the same.    Customer support is as worthless as this app. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. The idea is great but sadly, it doesn't work. Save your time and the headache this App will give you.",2016-11-16 17:20:31
Works well for me!!!,False,5,mgad1302,This app did great for me. I am able to retrieve my own health history especially lab results. The best part was when I was registering my son for school I had his account linked and I could pull his immunization history in my phone. Works well for what it has been designed for.,2016-07-08 14:36:50
Worst medical app ever!,False,1,JAG9882,"I'm starting to believe that this app was written in 10 minutes, rolled out, and then put on auto-pilot.  Never to be touched again.  It hasn't worked correctly for me since day one. I filled out a form for support-never heard back.  I've asked different offices of the multiple physicians I see and the registrars just say ""they don't know"", and the nurses repeat that, along with a blank look as if it's the first time they heard an app even existed!  Fix/enhance the app, or just shut it down altogether, it's not worth it.",2016-06-06 11:06:17
Works ... But needs tweeking,False,3,Riredpanda,"Been using for about two months ... Wished I could give the app a 5.
1) a ""how to"" basics user guide would be helpful.  I.E. What the colours and lines mean on graphs and charts.
2) blood sugar log only has bfst/lunch/dinner pre/post BUT I'm disposed to log Night as well.  Up to 8 times a day NOT 6
3) about 20% of the time the Blood Sugar entry WILL NOT post.  
4) there should be a kinder way to say your results are ABNORMAL/OBESE/PRE-HYPERTENSION ... With maybe an ""what to do to improve"" in future
5) the doctors cannot review the logged results until you see them in person by handing them your phone
6) a ""sister/linked"" tablet or laptop version would be helpful.  In locations you are not allowed to use your personal phone.
Thank you",2014-09-12 23:53:08
Personal Healthcare Practice patient (concierge practice),False,1,Zxcvbnm=++*^##{][,"They put very little time or effort into this app. Not surprising as their MS-Windows website is not much better.

They did, however, manage to find the resources to design the app so that when a person selects a nickname for the ""From"" box it returns a notice that the name is already taken. To get past that notice one has to click ""OK"". At this point the screen goes back to the ""Reviews"" page and all the input is lost requiring the reviewer to start over.

CLEVER way to avoid bad reviews.",2016-03-09 18:05:24
Good overall with a couple of areas of improvement,False,4,eCw Ptnt,I like how I can interact sign my clinic and provider using the app. It's a nice alternative to the portal for quick/light health needs. Some improvements needed to make it a full replacement including real time appt scheduling and easier provider messaging. Excited for new versions to improve on these areas!,2015-05-05 03:10:05
Useful but needs improvement,False,3,kelso_7981,I like this app but I agree with another review. It needs improvement. It would be nice to have a record of emails sent and if they have actually been read. Also alerts or something along those lines if you have received an email from your doctor or nurse. Other than those things the app is helpful and I love using it.,2017-03-03 15:19:17
Getting better,False,5,CallMeMarkieNotMarcus,"My doctor had my name different for easy login, so I had to use my full name and then it worked. other than that my doctor is now showing my labs and even answering refill request. Hope it keeps getting better.",2016-08-21 21:00:21
What happened??,False,2,PoLiWaVeSHi,"This started out incredibly impressive. I couldn't say enough good things about having access to my medical records 24/7 right on my phone, But then there was an update and the whole thing has become complete unusable. It says link your portal account and I must of entered the correct information over 50 times and got absolutely nothing...I hope to see it back up and running soon, it's very useful!",2015-12-10 04:56:25
Great app!,False,5,Planet Funk,"I have been using Healow for some time now and I love it!  The product is easy to use.  I like

That I can link my activity tracker and weight scale to my app so my doctor can see my progress.",2015-10-06 18:17:48
Three and a half,False,3,Done4nau,"I like the concept of the app. I find the notes from doctors printed in pale grey in tinier type than all the other print, which is very inconvenient. 
Sometimes notes go away. Was it something I've done? Did my doctor change her mind?
I don't want stuff to go away--ever. This is a permanent record. It is so good to be able to compare numbers from one year to the next.",2017-04-22 06:47:08
Great app !,False,5,Puppybae,"My doctor has been asking me to download the healow app for months now and I finally did . It's a great app , it allows me to make an appointment online and manage my care better . I recently had to go to the ER and it was really helpful to have my medical information right in my app .",2016-08-16 20:04:58
Works well!,False,5,BrittSus,"I can see my visit summary right through app, see upcoming appointments, results, current meds. My practice uses it to let patients know about upcoming flu shot clinics, new providers or general information. I also communicate directly to my doctor and it's so fast and easy.",2015-09-24 23:50:53
Integration with other tracking apps needed.,False,3,gutters,"I am not likely to manually enter this info of all my activities regularly. But if this app allowed integration with apps like Runkeeper for physical activities and Withings for blood pressure, fat percentage, weight and BMI. This would eliminate the need to enter each kind of data by hand each day. 
I hope someone reads this and considers these changes. Could be an app saving update.",2014-05-06 23:28:36
Great but,False,4,jgamble093,"Slow to integrate into new technology. The health app integration should be there, it's been months since its release. And with apple watch launching that support seems likely delayed based on progress so far. On the flip side I do love that it intergrates so well with my dr. Office as well as my medical reports and history. If that all tied into health app it would be 5 star",2015-02-28 06:30:41
Mixed,False,3,Luther Ipock,This has probably the best graphics and overall look of all the calendar apps out there.  Sadly it falls short on some key issues.  Very slow to respond to key strokes.  In addition it does not have a real time sync between devices.  This makes it almost impossible to use this app as your default calendar.  Correction of these faults would make this one of the great 5 star apps.,2013-10-20 03:39:59
Okay but needs Fitbit work,False,3,kyot58,"Overall it's fine. Nothing new other apps don't provide. What I find interesting is that it links well with my Fitbit Flex but the sleep is nowhere near accurate. It's not pulling any data from the Fitbit, I can assure you of that. Fitbit says 3h 56m and Healo says 9h 10m. I've used it for a week now and NO days are anywhere close. You have some work to do, developers.",2015-04-16 03:41:35

APP IS AMAZING,False,5,k.galutera,"For people who wants to see their own PHR, CCD when they visit the doctor this app is good.

Medication Alerts,False,2,Nicalatino,"Because I work in medicine both emergency medicine and pharmacology, I have a few friends and family that I take care of so I use another app so I can manage all under one app. Two things that need to be looked into. 
1. Allow patients who has someone taking care of them use the same portal as the rest of the group so there will be no need for additional apps. 

2. Please, please have a way to turn off the medication alerts . I have tried several times.  They still alert me, even on meds the patient no longer takes. 

3. Have the ability to pull up past labs, records in the event you're seeing a new doctor, who would like to see what past labs you have, put archive function.",2017-05-08 04:12:54
Worthless,False,1,Kea925,"No medical data or records, not even vitals are populated. Go online instead. The app is utterly worthless.  I also had a glitch in setting up the PIN, because after entering the last digit the screen froze, then I received instructions to go Patient Portal to retrieve it, and that was a dead end. I deleted the app and relaunched and was able to reset my PIN. The app also crashed a couple times causing me to log back in. Nothing spells ""app failure"" more than an app that is launched with problems.",2014-10-01 16:58:15
Good as far as it goes.,False,3,TimJ,"A decent way to get your medical info. Sometimes a little confusing finding where the information is stored - under tests, appointments or somewhere else.

Cool look and easy to use,False,5,MrsTamberine,Finally an app that makes it easy to get information about lab results and appointment reminders.  I can even set reminders and get directions to the office. If I want to ask a question u can send a message.  Simple and useful.,2013-02-12 13:35:33
Very user friendly,False,5,Tweety2258,"This is an awesome app. It helps me communicate with my doctor and allows me to view my medical record on my iPhone.

Lengthy and unreasonable user agreement,False,1,carmatt-m,One of the longest user agreements you'll see on any iOS application.

Despite a few minor speed improvements the app is still the clunky old interface it was a year ago when I gave it two stars

It still just seems like it's in the beta phase",2016-12-22 12:59:48
"Garbage app, garbage website",False,1,Ama2016,Completely broken app and website. Went through three different processes to reset password and none of them worked. Text verifications doesn't work. Password reset doesn't work. Desktop website doesn't work on mobile devices. Mobile website doesn't display correctly on mobile devices. Garbage company probably paid bottom dollar for their web development.,2016-06-07 09:07:48
Don't Bother With This Useless App,False,1,HMIrritated,"Absolute garbage. First, the idea of my personal medical info going through yet another 3rd party is idiotic.  Second, I was sent this app rather than an encrypted email from a health care provider. I am fairly tech savvy and have worked with computers for 30 years but I could not get this program to download after 3 tries, each time bring informed that it had been - no new icon, no listing in settings. What a freaking waste.",2016-03-19 06:41:33
Great app,False,5,Christinal37459,I think this app is very useful. I like that I'm able to see all my information straight from my phone. It provides an easy way to keep track of my medical records and medications. I also love the appointment reminders nice job!,2015-07-09 21:47:27
Awesome idea — terrible execution,False,1,Tom Arthur,"""the device is out of sync” … every single time. That’s fine, why not just fix it and not tell me about it? The app is has progressively become harder to use. I don’t understand how they developers think that anyone needs that error message. 

Yes, I just opened the app. Obviously it’s going to be out of sync. It’s your job to sync with your server. That’s what you do when the app opens. Just do it. Don’t waste my time telling me it’s out of sync.",2015-01-02 17:32:28
Excellent update!,False,5,TheSkaterDad,"I’ve been a user since v1. Love being able to connect to my doctor's office, see my health records and send messages. Now I can track my own blood pressure. Big interface improvements with this version.",2014-09-12 13:41:09
Needs major work!,False,2,Serenity26,"It does not seem to sync the current information from my doctor's office.  Says I have no medications, but yet I've been on at least 2 consecutively for the past 9+ months.  Some functions/options don't work, and mine tends to crash every now and then.  I have the latest iOS, so I know it's nothing on my end.   Perhaps this app is not being supported anymore!",2017-01-03 19:37:56
Easy & Functional!!!,False,5,H4mmer50,"I'm usually weary about these kinds of apps, but this Healow app is easy to use and fully functional. The app design is appealing. The information is displayed in a user friendly way, and navigation is easy too. 
So far so good!",2016-12-14 08:56:03
recent update killed the app,False,2,anniechan,it wasn't great but also wasn't that bad before the resent iOS update. it's no longer working on my 5s. UI could use a makeover. in general I thought it was convenient for appointment records and lab test results viewing. helpful when I could manage multiple family members and their accounts from different clinics on one single device. please fix this app.,2015-11-18 15:02:30
App is great,False,4,KB6124,The app it's self is great. I just wish we could actually check in with the app. I also wish my doctors office would check in with the app more often. I left a message on the app and it was two weeks before they responded to the message.,2017-01-31 13:42:13
Limited Usefulness - Content Has to be Shared,False,2,SoCal Jay,"The app works as intended, but is limited by what the doctors choose to share.  The summaries are uninformative, lab results aren't shared.  A week after an appointment is completed the only thing shared is that (It's Done).  

Usefulness only comes with sharing of content.   If it's not shared then the app is useless.  The app provider needs to work better with the medical community to make the app effective.",2015-11-15 15:23:55
Love it!,False,5,Katbysea,"Helps me communicate with doctor and know he gets exactly what I've said, keep up with appointments and I can look at and compare labs without waiting for a call. This is a great service and user friendly to the max!",2016-12-19 11:05:08
Lacking,False,3,Fred191145,"Some good stuff, some less so.  Tracking blood pressure allows Systolic  and Diastolic and even allows heart rate input, but does not track it.  Big time problem if one has rate issues.  
Also test results are not always secure, and by that I mean one day they are all there's, the next day most missing.   What's with this???",2017-01-26 21:54:04
Well Done,False,5,MrRef,"Easy to use, notes to the nurses returns quick response.  Being able to see all your records is brilliant. The app works very well, would highly recommend all doctors should use it.",2017-01-04 17:00:56
Worst App EVER!,False,1,Alaskan Paloma,"This app will have you chasing your tail from the start, it is poorly designed and horrible to navigate. In fact, it is SO bad, I've decided to give up on trying to find and review my lab results (the ones that tell me if I have cancer or not...). The added stress from this app is just what I wanted to deal with this morning! I hate it so much, I'm going to have to find a doctor who doesn't use this system to convey life-changing information...What a JOKE!",2015-08-21 16:46:28
"I agree with ""Can't get past the Pin"" review",False,4,Mosquito67,The exact same thing happened with me. Frustrating.

It worked I was able to establish my PIN!!!,2014-06-03 12:00:44
Work in progress,False,3,rchris_85,"Im glad you guys took the time to put out an app. I just hope you guys take (rather get) the time to continue to work towards improving it.

Unfortunately, the app wont let me sign in after a password reset. It says, ""congratulations!... Please log in with my new password."" Generally I don't like to congratulate my users when an error has occurred. 

*Touch sign in is easy to implement, so you might want to look into that. 

Adding a link for bug submission would be cool. It might allow you to get productive feedback from people that would otherwise vent on your ratings screen.",2015-11-20 13:05:30
Useful and convenient,False,5,Wellington Barney,"Pretty cool app, let's me see what exactly is wrong with me because I forget what my doc says a lot and I can send my Fitbit stuff to my doc so he knows I'm working! Useful and convenient especially with the update.",2016-07-08 13:25:49
Good idea but bad execution,False,1,Gmanhou,"I don't know how this gets four half stars. I think it is a very poor app. My doctor and nurse of now replaced telephone calls with text messages. Not very handy for answering questions. Moreover, the app doesn't let you see what messages you send and when they were sent. Also there's no real indication that your message is going to anyone specific other than the doctors practice. I am really disappointed in this app.",2014-03-10 14:16:53
Your health record at you fingertips,False,5,Philly5244,You can see all of your medical information at a touch of your password. No need to write it all down or try to remember what your doctor said.,2017-02-28 15:55:56
Website not available,False,1,Papa044,"Received app link & sign up from my doctor.  Downloaded app and cannot connect to site on either iphone5 or iPad.  Website keeps telling me it's not available at this time.  Laptop login went ok.  Tried app support link but it only ask/allows for specific questions.  Needs spot for ""other problems"".  If I can't login with iOS device then app only gets one star, should be a minus one.",2017-02-28 14:43:57
Great App,False,5,Farmgirl1896,I'm so pleased with this app. It is helpful to get my medication reminders and see my lab reports as the office receives them. I would like to have the option to pay the office using the app too. It would be nice added feauture.,2017-01-06 21:33:22
Works For Me,False,4,Eboney.Forte,I already use the patient portal. Was able to sync two accounts from two providers in less than five minutes. I think the key is using the website before setting up the ap.,2013-11-26 19:45:42
Non-user Friendly,False,1,SMARSON75,This app is non-user friendly.  No option to search in the help section.  No way to customize or personalize your account.  Will not let you change or add info - just kept kicking me out to the log in screen. I love my dr and the clinic/hospital I use but this app that they link with their patient portal is a poor choice on their part.  I wouldn't have given it a star but it wouldn't let me send without it,2017-05-07 01:33:49
Great App... Time Saver!!!,False,5,NSIBTM,I love this healow app... I can lookup and book appointments anytime and from anywhere.. I dont have to call my practice now..

Wastes Time.,False,1,LRRP 7,"If I can write it with less than one store I would. It does not serve the purpose for which its intended. After about an hour of dealing with it , Realized for the time I had spent with this app, I could've driven down to my doctors office and gotten hard copies of the information and paid my bill in person. I found it to be I The equivalent of useless. It was not worth any more of my time. I would not recommend it to an enemy.",2015-10-01 15:14:52
Awful,False,1,Mb1690,"Used to love this app but lately when I try to get into the full message portion it tells me my login is incorrect, despite already being logged in. Then it kicked me out and said my account was deactivated by my doctor, which I know isn't true. So I try resetting my password through email, 30 seconds later I click on the link and it says the link has expired. Serious bugs need to be fixed.",2015-08-23 04:22:11
Like the access; execution needs work.,False,2,NikiSue9,"I like being able to contact my doctor, and I love the access to messaging, etc.  The messages function is woefully lacking.  If my doctor leaves me a message more than 3 (short) lines long, I have to log into the website on a computer to read the full thing, and that effectively negates the purpose of the app.",2015-08-03 23:24:33
Works great for Me,False,5,Bbbbbbb. Ssssss,No problems at all. Quick set up and my information from the patient portal is readily available. Glad I didn't pay attention to the negative reviews.,2013-12-04 19:59:12
Works Ok,False,4,Chuckecm,I had the same problem as others had with app crashing.  Deleted app and created account using web browser.  Reloaded app and logged in using password created on web.  App now works as it should.  Have app on IPhone and IPad.,2013-09-05 19:35:56
Fantastic!,False,5,Skitchparks,I went to the doctor and within 48 hours I was able to read my labs and all other info my doctor has. Very handy and useful. So many great features. Beats anything Kaiser Permanente or United Health Care have.,2016-08-08 15:49:08
This app needs to be updated immediately.,False,1,Zatise,"This app needs support for the Apple Watch. This app fails at what it was designed to do. It doesn't work with HealthKit or the Apple Watch, can sync my data from the app to my phone. Just a horrible experience. 

Please update and add support for HealthKit and the Apple Watch. It's 2016 and almost 2017 let's go.

It's 2017 and this app still lacks the ability to pair an apple watch, I mean it's an iOS app why wouldn't that be implemented. Also why doesn't the app work with health kit? Needs an overhaul in designed as well, maybe a dark mode.

Still NO apple  ⌚️ support????????????? What about health app??????? I wish my doctor didn't require me to use this app since it's useless for me.",2017-05-16 21:34:49
Medication Reminder needs more options,False,3,Jai Ho,"I mostly wanted to use the app as a reminder for my meds, but the one med I have the most trouble remembering to take is one that I take only once every two weeks.  There is not an option for the frequency within the app, only daily or weekly.",2014-01-02 18:42:49
Reviews are a little misleading,False,4,Blake Powers,"I logged into that app great. Wish there was an option to integrate with Healthkit and my Apple Watch.

App works bur missing data,False,2,SY_23,"App works and its a step in the right direction. I am using it with my Clinical EMR (I am a doctor). However, it displays VERY limited data. We started using health gorilla which is a similar app but has all my patients labs and rads and documents from all vendors and other doctors, not just my EMR. I think this app would succeed if they went outside the confines of a single doctors office..",2014-11-14 23:56:58
Works great!!!,False,5,Lreap,I'm not sure what the other problems were do to... But I was already using the website and this was a very quick transition. Took 10 secs to setup and start using!,2013-08-30 23:47:46
It works for me!,False,5,Mo Amore,"After my physical, all my results was there. If I was single, I would request sex partners to show me their results before having sex. At least it's giving me an idea of their health lifestyle.",2015-09-03 15:03:48
"Decent features, confusing interface",False,2,rbodgers,"Having access to my medical records like this is amazing. But this app has some of the strangest, least intuitive navigation I've ever seen in an iOS app. It's very confusing, at times, and very frustrating.

Plus, no HealthKit support.

I love my doctor. But I'll be on the lookout for a doctor that works with a better system.",2017-01-04 16:15:50
Great idea. Very useful app,False,5,Steven Labrecque,I was able to find my doctors office and see my portal info. The meds cabinet is great for med reminders. Also love that I can add my family's accounts to the same app. Great job!!!! Keep up the good work... :),2013-02-16 03:07:49
Poor QA,False,1,Ragtag2,"Downloaded, installed and found my Dr's practice but cannot login and what's worse is no error message just bounces back to login screen. Was able to get to Accept T's and C's, but again no login. 

As an IT Manager myself, I'd be embarrassed if my team wanted to put something this poor into production. Even ""free"" isn't worthwhile if it doesn't work. I'll never get those 30 minutes I wasted back and I really wanted it to work!",2013-02-13 20:51:23

excellent app,False,5,Cmilli17,"this is an excellent app, those who complain about the passwords etc. write it down....  My physicians site is excellent and this mirrors it.  I will say it is only as good as your physicians application to it.  So far no problems with this app.",2013-08-12 13:53:16
Annoying and Useless marketing tool to push ads,False,1,Rttt33,AVOID THIS Annoying and Useless piece of software pushed on me by my doctors office. Hard to use with buggy pass wording.   I wasted half an hour trying to get it to run as the presumed portal for my lab results. Unnecessary and annoying distraction.   Perhaps of interest to utopians who think that connecting to your Fit bit and staring into your hand all day will make your life any better.,2016-06-29 12:58:50
Doesn’t work!!!!!,False,1,luckydag1,I wish you could rate this no stars.  I can’t believe a company that rights software for Doctors offices to keep patience records secure is so bad.  I have tried several time to link the app to my account with my Dr. office with no avail.  It keeps telling me I have no account available even after I login to my portal.  There tech support needs to address this issue very soon.  Great idea very poor follow through.,2016-03-11 01:14:38
Customer service is awful!,False,1,Heatherjhall,"I was having issues logging in to the app and after contacting customer service, it took them 2 MONTHS to get back to me to help.  The app had been deleted by then.  When they did decide to finally help, they kept sending emails hounding me about it.  I think they let me wait that long, they should have to wait just as long for me to get back to them.",2016-01-12 15:59:24
?!?!,False,1,Maebh013,"The idea of this app is great, the hospital I go to actually has a very easy to use patient portal app, but for insurance reasons my sons go to a different hospital group, this app is horrible. The ease of use is very poor, the layout and direction is confusing. I messed up when setting up one account and can't reset or make another, there's no way to start a new one once one has been created. Please improve the app",2015-12-11 22:57:43
This fall grossly short of promises,False,1,Niall of the 9,"Using on an iPhone.  My PCP wants me to use it. The communication between the PCP and myself has decreased. My other physicians within the GBMC network are not using this.  I have tried to give them time to fix it; but, it has actually gotten worse.

Also, the app won't stay linked with my dr's portal account and when I link to it and log in (yet again), the app goes back to the home page with my appointment notification clearly waiting and I'm back at square one. App closes and my account is no longer linked. Argh!",2016-09-28 19:26:38
Worthless app!,False,1,warubozu65,"Luckily it was a free download for it would definitely been a waste of money! Although there are many features, they do not retain any of your information. Also keeps ""looping"" you in a circle when trying to message your doctor. App also crashes and you have to start your journey all over again! Very frustrating and like I said, ""worthless app!""",2016-09-20 07:27:20

Most inaccurate suckiest app ever,False,1,Careyidaho,"NOTHING in this app re: my medical information was correct. I can't get my labs, the dr's note are incomplete or don't come up at all. I can't believe i pay money for medical care and THIS is how I'm supposed to get my information. And when you call for assistance it goes straight to voicemail.

Great App,False,5,PaulP1981,"Works great. I have been using this app since last year after my PCP Dr Sood's office told me about it. I can view my lab results, refill my meds, book my appointment online. Don't need to call his office anymore.",2016-07-08 14:08:34
Not useful,False,1,John McF,"For visits it presents server errors as is. An error 500 detailed trace back from a tomcat server isn't the sort if thing you expect a user to view.

Needs work but useable if patient,False,4,DJ Megahertz,Like most I too had issues with the PIN. Said to go to the web portal to reset but that was BS!  Trick is to delete app and reinstall. Then create your pin. Second time seems to work. After that the app does a good job.,2013-12-15 02:27:34

Great App,False,4,Lyn1969,"I like the app except that I don't get a response from the doctor through the app. I'm not sure if that is the doctor's fault or an issue with the app. Otherwise the app is awesome. I see my medicine, all of my labs, and doctor's notes. Love it!!!",2016-12-19 15:41:52
Nonfunctional app with No Technical support!,False,1,MadManMark,"I have sent countless pleas for help to the Healow technical support.
Some advice: I finally (after 9 frustrating months) got this app to work. I found that delegating the app, reinstalling the app, delegating the app, reinstalling the app, delegating the app, and reinstalling the app finally allowed me to access my account. Healow is a very glitchy app and takes numerous attempts to get a functional copy installed. Good luck!",2016-04-10 14:09:44
Sort of Works,False,3,AbbeyUndead,"I can't get the tracker feature to work. The app says I have successfully linked the tracker feature to my Fitbit account, but the tracker never updates daily data from Fitbit to Healow. Everything else but this feature works for me.",2016-08-17 20:19:15

Poor Design & Non-functional,False,1,Ccsrgv,"Poor Design & does not conform to Apple iOS as it does not support landscape mode.
Also, among its' other failures, it does not allow user to reply to messages. Instead, user must attempt to create a new message which is not trackable, nor can it be associated with a received message.
This app simply demonstrates the (typical for eClinicalWorks) frustratingly poor execution of an otherwise good idea.",2014-12-03 04:18:10
Kind of neat,False,3,Alpesh P,I was finally able to get past the pin setting after reinstalling the app. Handy way to get lab results on my phone. Cumbersome to navigate the app but still easier than logging into the website every time I want to check. Nice aesthetic UI.,2014-04-19 13:11:54
Pretty good but needs a fix or two,False,3,Kats1965,"Overall good, however the email process is frustrating. When I receive an email, I cannot reply.  I have to start a new email. I should be able to create a normal email chain/conversation.",2016-12-19 19:00:28

Glitchy,False,3,ilva52,I can't find my doctor even though I had this app on my old phone. I downloaded the app on my new phone and I had to start from the beginning and can't find my doctor and have not gotten an email back from tech support yet.,2015-10-07 20:05:03

Could be great but it isn't.,False,2,Slaughter17,"App could be more robust. However, the amount of information it provides is very basic.

Dissatisfied,False,1,Jimbo0273,"I tried to use this app and had difficulty login in. Had password reset and told it was successful yet still can't login.

Not great,False,1,MrsTucker2011,"This app never works. When I load it and chose an option 99% of the time it doesn't work. The only thing that works consistently is the log in. After that it will randomly close the app or just not let you click on any options.

Wouldn't even give it one star,False,1,Yoyoyoyoyoyoyo2222,"Useless. I just wanted to see my X-rays from my provider but could only do so through the app, so I downloaded it and after 20 minutes of creating an account and agreeing to some mysterious license agreements, I was finally ready to see the x rays.

When it works!,False,3,T SKULLY,It's not a bad app when it works. I don't know if it's the app or the doctor's office but I've had tests done and they are not on here. A message  or email notification would also be nice as I don't look at this app daily.,2017-01-12 14:51:02
Terrible app,False,1,Bi-curious princess,This app was supportive make things easy but it's a waste. Every time I try to make appointments it shows me doctors that's all the way out of my area.

Problems with PIN (it won't accept it yet lets me in anyhow), need to keep closing and reopening my account to get any functionality, missing medical data, constant crashing.

Horrible,False,1,explosive diary,One of the few times I think technology has caused a process to devolve. The messages don't fully display. So then I have to contact the doctors office and start over. And they are pushing us to use this app which is annoying. This should have been an easy quality/bug test before rolling out.

Worthless app,False,1,"Mike F.

Very unfriendly to Users,False,1,Namelocdet,"This is not a basic ""even a kid could use it"" app. Read the other negative reviews... all true. Especially the help desk reviews.

Can't read test results,False,2,Gamegirl917,"Is it me or can anyone read their test results?  I see the test and date it was performed, but I cannot open any of the links. This defeats the purpose if having access to these records, doesn't it?  Not impressed with this software.",2014-07-24 10:50:15
Freezes up,False,1,cwayneallenjr,Every time I try to setup my account on the app when I get to the choose a pin screen it says saving and tries for a minute or so then crashes.

Poor UX,False,1,DiverBW,"This app does not work well. Poor user experience. Little things like resetting the fields of forms back to defaults after you've typed in different information, etc.

I hope it works,False,1,trains4one,I spend a great deal of time on the road.  Downloaded the app this morning about 2000 miles from my home.  Tried to enter my current home town and it tries to match the name to either clinics or doctors in the location I'm in.  App needs to be tweaked to allow searching outside you immediate location.,2013-02-13 15:20:54
Can't seem to even sign in-,False,1,patioelf,Nothing like starting off with confusion and bad instructions. It took me right to page where it told me to sign in but there was no option to even register as a new user. Looked for instructions and after 20 minutes I have to give up.

Totally useless,False,1,Rsm9222,"It's virtually impossible to obtain test results from this mobile app. It shows that there are test results, but the way the app is designed it is not possible to view the results.

Healow app,False,1,Cydmac,This app drives me crazy. Leads you in circles with inability to add other medical providers.

Good app; could be better,False,4,davidhanddotnet,"I like this app, but it could be significantly better with a few improvements.

TEST RESULTS: The My Records area, in particular, could use some help. To begin with, since it primarily aggregates test results, why not instead label it ""Test Results""?

The formatting of the test results display is poor and difficult to read compared to the desktop browser version, and it would be useful to make the abbreviations and acronyms in the left-most column clickable links to brief explanations of what they mean — perhaps including sub-links to more detailed explanations from some authoritative source.

Finally, I'm not sure if the arrival of new test results can optionally generate a notification on the phone's home screen or not (I've not noticed that they have), but if not, they should. So that users don't have to continually open the app and tap in their passcode just to see if new test results have been posted.

MESSAGES: It's frustrating that the Messages area only displays incoming messages (the desktop browser interface displays both incoming and outgoing messages), so it's necessary to screenshot or cut-and-paste outgoing messages to create a record of them on the phone. Permitting the display of only one side of a conversation seems likely to needlessly generate confusion and repetition.

And while we're on the subject, an indication that an outgoing message has been read would be useful in communicating the status of a conversation.

PASSCODE: It would be great if tapping in the passcode would keep the app open and accessible until the phone is locked, even if it's necessary to go to another app and then return. Because the abbreviations and acronyms used in test results are undefined, as noted above, it's necessary for non-medical professionals to go back and forth to Google, for example, for help in understanding them. Currently, each and every time users return to the app, it's necessary to tap in the passcode again. Health data security is of course extremely important from the standpoint of HIPAA, and for other reasons, but this feels like pointlessly time-consuming excess, and it's frustrating.",2016-10-13 16:23:54

Horrible useless app!!!,False,1,Marc Huberman,"This app is a complete waste of time. I first learned of this app when told to register/check-in at the kiosk yesterday; while at a doctor appointment.  After entering the required info, it even found my insurance info; which had already been entered by the office prior to my appt. Upon complete of filling out the fields onscreen, it said I have completed the registration process.  I can then log out and have a seat in the waiting room.  I sat down and waited 15+ minutes.  This seemed odd, as other people arriving after me were just checking in at the front reception and being seen?  I asked the rep at the front what was going on- I registered at the kiosk as the ""HUGE SIGN"" states.  She proceeded to tell me that my data entry was not received?  I was not even registered?  I even received an email confirming my registration, login and temporary password.  Basically, it was not working!  Fun times!!!  The next day I tried downloading the app to my iPhone with ""zero"" luck!  It downloads and asks for a login name and password.  I entered the info- it didn't accept it. It said my info was incorrect?  I then reset my password, after attempting to log in with the temporary one I was sent.  The system sent me a confirmation email that my password was updated.  So I tried to login again and it still does not recognize me at all?  This was a fun waste of ½ hour.  I proceeded to call the Doctor's office. They said I am doing it wrong?  What the heck?  This is a basic protocol that requires simple directions to be followed.  It is nice to see that someone spent $25 million dollars on a box of rocks!  Thank you developers for doing such a bang up job!  Lastly, I tried logging in from my desktop iMac-  Well, you guessed it; no luck here either.  Hats off to earning one star.

UPDATE: SOLVED -- No Tech Support or Bug Report Options,False,3,Batrico,"Update 23 feb: PIN crash resolved. 
While unable to use the app on my iPhone due to the chronic PIN crash as reported widely, despite delete/reinstall, I was able to set it up and use it on my iPad. Per tech support request via that device, I was advised to delete and reinstall on my iPhone a second time. Success. Suggest others try it.

FEEDBACK:
- please add tech support options and contact form on the  main website so one has a hope of getting through when the app fails and no working app exists to provide a feedback option or support request.

- please ditch the Marker Felt font in the appt. notes section; Helvetia, please; also, the notes don't seem to support Unicode; bullets were garbled upon closing and reopening for review.

- please add vital stats tracking/entry functions; I.E., supply daily input options for recording blood pressure (AM/PM, right/left arm, etc.), pulse, pulse/ox, weight (AM/PM), med compliance/effectiveness/side effects, diet/calorie tracking, mood/stress recording, etc.

-allow graphing and history of said data; allow submission to PCP.

- add reminders options to input various data sets at given times;

- add option for repeating reminders for meds and vitals, I.e., repeat reminders at regular intervals until user confirms meds consumed or vitals are entered (or skipped with option to input reason). In other words, a nag feature that must be acted upon.

- add option to list new/continuing complaints/symptoms and submit when ready for doctor review to allow doc to determine if an appt is necessary, rather than simply scheduling what may be an unwarranted appt. 

This app is a good start for a changing industry. 

======== original feedback==========
I don't normally punish an app with 1 star reviews for bugs, but since there is no contact form, support form, or bug report form on the ""help"" website listed for this app, I will chime in with everyone else complaining of crashes when entering your PIN.

Side note: I can login with a user ID, maybe - but there’s no place to setup an account, including on their website. If there is, it is buried. You guys have some work to do.",2022-05-12 15:14:48
Crap app,False,2,not another one😡,"Well I have tried to get into the app recently and not only does it not work it does not recognise me, as I have been with my medical practice now for a number of years this came of some surprise. There are different ways to get in and I tried them all including ‘forgetting’ changing my password. I actually used the same password I had originally used and it did accepted it as a new one! I have contacted them via advised address and received an e mail.The email gave instructions said to follow this route and try again you can guess what happened. Does not recognise me as a patient.

I have now deleted the app as it was useless. I managed to get an email with access to a patient ‘portal’ address but not all information is on there and it’s not clear or easy to use. 

I might reload the app again as it was useful when it worked,  right now when I need it it’s an absolute pain and writing to those responsible for it has been a waste of time.",2022-05-11 21:27:10
Doesn’t Seem to Work,False,1,DragonLadyof88,"I saw my doctors office used this app and decided to try and download it so I’d have access on the go. However when signing up for it, I had to search for the code to my doctors practice. I found it and when I typed it in, it tried to link me to a practice 170 miles away. I kept researching and even when I landed on the correct one, it tied me to the one 2 hours (170 miles) away. Needless to say, I couldn’t access my records and the only appointments I have showing is the one a few weeks ago and I’ve had a couple since then and it isn’t showing none of my upcoming.

Reason for my rating……,False,4,ErisNyx78,"The only reason I only gave it a 4-star is because for the most part this app has been extremely helpful & allows me to access things I wasn’t able to access w/out either hours, days, or weeks going by before I actually got a of response. However, I will say this, Dr. Troy Richardson and the nurses that help him, pretty much all of the nurses there, are the only reason that I drive all the way, or ride the bus all the way, all the way down to Midvale, UT from North Ogden UT. I have now been with Dr. Richardson for 2 1/2 years & I have never had any other complaints other than, & this is partially my fault, there’s been paperwork that has been missed or there’s been some miscommunication. The one thing that I truly believe could improve this whole situation, not just the app, but the call ins, everywhere else people who can’t get the app, everything is there instead of having one main hub of where u can call in to leave a message for ur specific doc is or would be taken care of if each clinic had its own phone number that we could be transferred to so that we could then asked to speak with a doctor or leave a doctor a message or note or something in someway shape or form that he will get more immediately than he would if it came from another office which would then have to send it to his office who would then have to file it & get it to the correct provider. It makes it more complicated than it needs to be and otherwise I would give it 5🌟 all the way baby!

Total Rubbish !!!,False,1,ChrisLPNM,"I have been getting an error message for over a week so I decided to delete and reinstall the app.  Every app on the planet asks you if you already have an account - except for this one.  It makes you register all over again.  And if you don’t know your provider code, welcome to your lesson in futility.  I entered my doctor’s name in every possible combination I could think of and kept getting a doctor not found message.  So then I clicked on the can’t find your doctor link, started to fill out the form, and when I tried to enter the state of my doctor’s address it wouldn’t  let me type it in and it doesn’t provide a drop down menu.  And you can’t submit the form without the state field completed.  What an absolute joke.  If my doctor was as good as this app, I would be 6ft under.  Ridiculous.",2022-03-15 01:29:47

Anything Healow RUN!!,False,1,Mljohnson1123,"I can’t stand this app! Absolutely useless. Well maybe not entirely but mostly. I can see lab results IF I can access my doctors profile. You see trying to add a new doctor code information is impossible. You can try from many different angles to try and add your doctor but it doesn’t work. Or it’s a long and strenuous process. There are such better medical health apps out there I wish my providers had chosen. These companies work so hard at keeping medical information so secure that it’s secure from even the patient. Anytime I try to reach out to help support for issues regarding healow it’s a dead end. I include screen shots and explanations of the issue but they respond 24 hours later, because they are in another country, and don’t even address the issue I raised. Oh and I might add their help desk,  English proficiency is a little lacking.

Does not respect my choices,False,1,bramblesmudge,"Boo! My app no longer works since I updated it, because it now insists that I put a passcode on my device. Note that there is a PIN code built into the app, but it will not work unless I also have a passcode to unlock my phone. I understand that the intent is to protect my privacy, but I have made an informed CHOICE not to use a passcode on my phone. I have my reasons. I am an adult. I understand the risks. Now the app is useless. How about respecting your users’ autonomy? The app was only so-so anyway, but it’s the one that my doctor’s office selected. Now I don’t have a secure messaging option, so I’ll have to do everything by voice phone calls. Inconvenient for me, my doc, and the office staff.",2022-02-04 22:40:53

Requiring iPad Passcode NOT OK,False,1,KCBERC,Used the app on my iPad for years w/no issues.

I can’t even log in to my account due to the same error every time - “Looks like something went wrong, please try again later.”  I’ve gotten this same error message for multiple months now on the same step of simply trying to log in for the first time and create a password. It’s great that I haven’t been able to access a single medical report from my provider for 6 months of my pregnancy because I can’t even log in.  Also, they appear to market that they offer telehealth visits.  That’s be nice right?  Except that my provider said these visits don’t work on a phone or tablet, only a desktop.

iPhone passcode required?,False,3,Kaaaal4546746565,"App has nice features, but the iPhone unlock passcode requirement is frustrating. I don’t want to have to have a passcode on my iPhone just in order to use the app. The app already has a passcode on it that you have to use anytime you want to open it.

Poorly designed app,False,1,dwd2408,"Nearly impossible to get into the patient lab portal. No way to even get to a login page.

Developer collects information from phone,False,1,Kriscerone,App will not allow you to access it unless your device has a passcode on it.

“Does not collect data…”,False,1,dreambeaver,"This app attaches itself to your iPhone passcode. The statement that Healow does not collect data is untrue. To use the app you MUST allow it access to your phone information.

There is no reason whatsoever why Healow needs to be attached to the basic phone operation of any user. Larger and more efficient portals are used by the Mayo Clinic, along with A multitude of professional medical apps do NOT attempt to attach an app to other personal information on any device.

Everybody puts the info in for me and the sends me an email to tell me the info is in there. I have a practice code, but when I try to download the app and it starts taking my name and birth date and hit “continue” it doesn’t continue. Just the latest of why I have never been able to communicate through the app. I think I will quit wasting my time, and go back to speaking to the office, and the nurses, and the doctors on the phone….it works every time….even the space for this review won’t continue without stopping me for a nicname…and the nicname I chose…ALREADY TAKEN!?",2021-10-27 19:59:12

Constantly terrible,False,1,Danjzee,I have tried to use this terrible app for a couple of years. It has fundamental flaws. It is difficult to navigate. It does not remember previous settings. It very easily forgets previous log in information. Even after several weeks or months I have to re-enter the same basic information. That involves finding the original doctor clinic ID number code. Resetting the password is also flawed. My browser simply says code expired. I could not reset it without calling the clinic and asking them to reset my login. Avoid this app. if at all possible.

What the $&@“ is this??,False,1,donnlawler,"In this early part of the 20th century one o would believe that apps that connect would have a clear path of development. With this Healow app, that is clearly not the case. When registering on a phone (which I would wager 90% of user would do) one is asked for a verification code sent via text. All good there, I’m glad to see some safety protocols in place at the start… but then one revives a code that begins with two letters of the Roman alphabet and the only input pad is the numerical pad of ones phone… no other option to switch to a standard keyboard to enter said letters… any attempt is going to be wrong and count against your limited attempts to even create a portal identity. I found this out the hard way… now imagine being elderly and not so tech savvy. The frustration this must cause on them is immeasurable. If this app would follow today’s protocol on establishing credentials and then option security protocols, it would be a fine app. As of now, it’s absolutely useless.",2021-09-24 14:55:58

I tried numerous times to get the phone verification code by text, and when a text finally came through with the code, it said the code was incorrect. I double checked the accuracy to confirm but it still said it was incorrect. After numerous other attempts I finally gave up.

I searched the practice by phone number and found it, so I tried logging in, but it wouldn’t accept my credentials, so I asked to reset my password.

My 17 character long randomly generated password with numbers, letters and symbols was repeatedly rejected for being “too weak”. I tried increasing and decreasing the number of characters to no avail.

WORST patient portal app ever—crap support,False,1,Scoutsgrl,"I’ve used many patient portal apps and I have NEVER had one that’s as frustrating and impossible to use as this one! Wanna speak to an actual human with support?! Yeah right. Apparently, this app’s developers’ time is more important than the patients who actually use it. There are so many places on this app where I can’t input any information because it won’t let me when I tap the screen. There’s no way to delete messages and if there is I have no clue where it is. If I want to access my medical records from say 4/1/20 through 1/7/21, why do I have to enter the year 2020 (on the far right) first in order to be able to enter a 4 (on the far left)? That’s just crappy app set up! If my new provider gives me a code to set up my portal account on Healow but I can’t enter that code because it won’t let me OK—so I try entering my providers name but it won’t let me change the city so I can’t even get things set up. I tried for a month to enter information in the app prior to my new patient appointment and every single time I attempted to enter the data (trying multiple devices, multiple computers, multiple windows programs) it kept giving me error messages and then wouldn’t save anything I’d entered. And support expects me to email back and forth with them for days and days trying to fix their problematic app?? I don’t have time. So why don’t I just not use it?? Well, I’d love that...except if I don’t use the app, I’ll get charged out the arse to get my own medical records, I won’t be able to communicate directly with my physicians outside of my appointments when they want me to, I can’t access my own test results or send them to other providers when my doctors office forgets to do it.

Then worst part is I got a Covid test & they emailed me that the result is in but I click on the Covid test & it doesnt even say the results anywhere?

It hasn’t actually reset. The ineptitude is startling.

Several emails were sent, none of the emails used the same language as the app, which made following the “directions” nearly impossible, and then on the times when I could decipher the directions to follow them, I was told I needed a pass code that nobody seemed to know anything about. 

#2. When sending a message, why must I pick my doctor AND the providing location?  Seems like just one more redundant step.   

#3. Why can I not see the message I sent when I get a reply?  

#4.  Why can I not reply to a message or when someone replies to my message?  I really have to create an entirely new message?

#5. The rest of the app is equally as clunky and non-user friendly. I’m very tech-savvy, and I struggle to use this thing.   I can’t imagine what the older sector of our population goes through when their provider DEMANDS they use this caveman app. 

Since this is the only way I can communicate with my healthcare provider, I’m being held hostage by a team of app developers who seem to have thrown this thing together using spare parts and chewed bubblegum.

App makes promises that are not accurate, ie you can look at appointments, statements, medical records etc etc, but you can’t. The doctor must give you a code to even access the app. Then it is still limited to what the doctor authorized you to see.

It search feature is inadequate, difficult to navigate and VERY slow person on a iOS13 device.

Please bear in mind, I rarely take the time to write a review.  No review is a great app.  You get a review, frustration is high and would rather not even deal with it.  Sorry for the negativity, but need to be truthful too.

Update:  I wrote this review for iOS7.  Today on iOS 13, it still a useless clunky app with the same exact errors.  Apple might as well Der are it and remove from their AppStore.

If you cannot register anywhere, how do you use the app???  Registering should be first thing that comes up.

In particular, the password reset email takes ages - by the time I get it and go to reset, the link has expired.  It is also annoying to have to have the practice code each time I login (who remembers that?!).  In addition, your multi-factor authentication is clunky.  Rather than have to enter my full name, birthday and phone number every single time, you should consider what every other portal does, which is to text a verification code to my mobile.  Your methods are also not secure;  it is industry standard to use ""out of wallet"" methods such as security Q&A.

When you got to easy sign on and tell it to call your secondary phone number it calls your cell number . When you go to add an unknown doctor it defaults to Alabama as state !

Lots of potential - but too many UE flaws,False,3,NYCCuban,"Minuses-
- App would not work when I refused to give location. Why do you need my location if I’m just entering a provider code?
- App did not tell me location was required. It just didn’t work - swirling and swirling after I entered code. Had to close app and start over. At least say its required if you just have it.
- Has a button to “book appointment” but it looks like my doctor doesn’t offer that. “How exciting,” I thought. “I can just book on this app and dont have to call anymore.” Hopes dashed - no way to actually do it despite the button. Don’t have a “book appointment” button if you can’t. I land on the providers page and there’s no “This provider doesn’t offer online appt bookings.” You just have to scroll up and down the page.
- Minor bugs throughout. Had to try everything twice. When messaging my doctor, it was clear I had to provide doctor and location info. Had to go back and try again. When trying to click on message, it expands, but then its not clear how to respond to that message, you have to create a new one

It’s become an app that I use more than I ever thought I would. I didn’t think I’d be using it as often as I do. But once I got it and realized how much I can do with it and how convenient it is for me, I use it all the time. I highly recommend this app. Just remember that if your provider doesn’t upload your records to Healow, then you can not access those on here. But your appointments will definitely be on the app. It’s very easy to get registered, you just download the app and your doctors office will email you a code to use to connect with them.

Wonderful Patient Support App! 😊,False,5,Vegas040805,"I love this Healow app! I would have rated 4 stars but it was only for slight inconveniences that I mention last. 
I use this app for tracking my medications, appointments, records and at some Dr locations you can check in on it. I have yet to try that because I forget about it when I’m there lol. You can also send and receive messages to your provider, AND you can access your medical records on this Healow app. This includes vitals, immunizations, insurance, referrals and more! It’s pretty amazing and VERY convenient. 

They also offer “Trackers” where it says you can track MANUALLY, pair a device, and/or they offer items for sale such as the  Fitbit, Nokia, Jawbone fitness devices. Also the iHealth and sleep trackers - but they may be higher priced on this app. 

DIABETICS: There’s the iHealth blood glucose monitoring package - quite pricey but it may be well worth it for people with diabetes. Just check prices on other websites also, but make sure you can pair with this Healow app if that’s your goal - to use the tracker on app. Best of all - the app is free and should remain that way! 

This app can definitely use some updates as listed below, but overall it’s a GREAT tool for people who want to be in charge of their own health and be their own advocates - which in today’s times, I highly recommend. YOU are your own best healthcare advocate! Take charge of your health with the new tools offered to us, because Dr’s can help us all better if we are organized and in control of our own health. “Help Doctors Help Me” is my motto. Best wishes and health to all! ~Andrea 😊

Okaaaay, so I attempted to log in to the online portal - NOPE. I checked, and YES, the user name and password were correct. So I went back to email and took the provided link (copied it), and went back to the browser window, pasted the link, and tried it again (which is what email suggested). NOPE. STILL couldn’t log in. So I went back to the app with the code for the provider (since I had added them by name, originally), and tried to add them. I was informed that I already was logged in with them.

One of THE Sorriest Apps I’ve Ever Used,False,1,gclunsf,"I’m retired with about 40 years of computing experience and about 6-7 years of iPhone & iPad app user experience. I can tell you, up-front, this is one frustrating, poorly designed, sorriest excuse for an app I’ve had the misfortune to use to-date. Here’s the problems:

1) Constructing a new strong account password the app will accept should not be the “rocket science” it seems to be. The password guidelines, some of which they supply on their web portal, are shown nowhere on the app screen where the new password has to be supplied. Showing ALL the guidelines is a common practice among most apps that handle input of of new passwords. Attempting to set a password for a new additional account under Healow seems next to impossible. It rejects them with a “New Password is very weak” message no matter how strong the password really is.

2) Once the user has started the process of adding a new account to Healow, ANY action by the user in navigating to another app before finishing the new account add  will result in the Healow app discarding ALL the information the user has input and take them back to a screen requesting their PIN code when going into settings. Why would a user navigate to another app while doing the new account add? I did it to refer to information needed for the new app addition process, such as the medical practice’s code and the userid and temporary password supplied by the medical organization, for example. I cannot say how absolutely frustrating and ridiculous this is and would be, especially, to inexperienced users. On this problem, alone, I give the app a “1-star” rating out of 5 stars. It shows exceedingly poor design and even poorer testing practices.

3) When adding an account by hitting the “+” in the upper right corner of the My Accounts screen, a screen is brought up in which the user should be able to search by the provider name, practice name, or practice code. However, when that screen is brought up, the app often proceeds beyond it to a list of provider names & addresses as might be useful if the user wants to search by provider name. However, no provider name has been supplied. Getting the screen to stop and allow the user to instead provide a practice name or practice code, as is my case, depends on the user trying to tap the screen in several places across several iterations. Again, this is the result of exceedingly poor design and poorer testing practices.

4) Customer Support is nearly non-existent for this app. I’ve gone back and forth with these folks about 3 times to try to resolve the password problem. They finally said to just contact the medical provider whose account I’m trying to add, and they’ll work it with them. That medical provider isn’t having the problem. I am. This demonstrates their unwillingness to work with their customers to fix problems.

Whatever you do, if you can, avoid this app like the plague!",2018-02-27 21:33:12
You can login once. Then never again.,False,1,BrianJamesPhoto,Sign up was easy using the code and temporary password provide by my doctor’s office. Everything was going smoothly until it asks you to setup a new password.

Even went through the reset process and changed it again. The result: “Cannot connect to server”. The old (temporary) password does not work anymore (obviously) so... that’s that. Yay!

So, ok, you say...if you don't like it, just delete the app and move on, right? Here's the f-ing  problem: my doctors insist on using it (or maybe they're told to by their medical group).

I would tell both my doctors offices about the problems I have had trying to get this app working with my iPad, but they know almost nothing about software, so that could be another problem. Why does eclinicalweb work, but HEALOW fails?

LOOK at the ratings, more than 500, with 3x more 1-star than any other ratings ... What does that tell you about this app? It's virtually impossible for most humans to use. Needs work.

I was able to read a note from the dr and view the lab results. All on my phone - I didn't even have to sit my lazy butt up in bed except to grab the temporary sign-in info sheet. :) 

I can also attach the kids' accounts to mine so one sign-in will access all of our records. Their info will require me to get up...so I will do it later. I will edit this review if I encounter a problem.

The dr office did not add vitals or 'problems' so I cannot view those. But that's not the fault of the app. It's the dr office not utilizing the service completely. 

I am able to renew prescriptions through the app. Maybe that is also a dr office choice on whether to allow it or not since another reviewer couldn't. It came right up in the medication list by tapping the + 

So, I experienced no crashing and no usability issues. There is a help section and a feedback form within the settings area.

No search ever loaded anything, I tried by location, name, and the code I was given, all found nothing, I don’t even know if it’s not in the database or I’m not even getting to the results page, because just nothing shows up, not even an error message. The coding is just so poor, I can’t believe this was even released in such a state. A couple bugs is fine but completely unworkable? Did anyone even test the software?",2015-03-27 20:43:59
Horrible app,False,1,RickDrums,"I would seriously like to know who these so called programmers are, I mean seriously. There is NO common programming sense whatsoever in this app. None. Just delete the source code and start over, maybe the next time they try they will read some blogs about how to program. Well maybe not.",2015-03-16 23:49:13
App freezes,False,1,Walkersr,This issue of the app freezing when trying to ad blood pressure is still an issue even after I installed the update today (10/22/2014). Please fix.,2014-10-23 01:19:24
What PIN?,False,1,Loophole64,"Let's go through this guys:
1. Search for my provider. It would have been nice if my provider gave me a code to make this easier, but I found them OK.
2. Accept agreement.
3. Log In with the info I got from my provider.
4. Accept agreement (another one?)
5. Enter Birthdate or phone number (this seems unnecessary.)
6. Change password and enter security question.
7. Login with your new password (why?? There's no reason for this.)
8. Enter 4 digit PIN... (What PIN???)

It never asked me to create a PIN and I wasn't given one. It tells me to login to the portal to retrieve my PIN. If I can log in to the portal with just username and password, why not the app? Of course, when I log in to the portal there is no way to retrieve my PIN...

This extra layer of security, even if it worked, is unnecessary and overly complex. You have to find a balance between security and usability, but in this case security shot usability off the teeter totter and into orbit.",2014-05-20 12:39:39
Crashes,False,1,Andimms,I have not been able to open the app fully. I enter my pin code and it crashes on the last number. Failure.,2013-12-28 17:01:49
Does not work,False,1,RnhNC,"This app does not work on an iPad (retina display running iOS7).  When downloaded, the app only functions in a portrait mode.  I can tolerate that, but when I first attempted to search for my provider, the app did not recognize my bluetooth keyboard; rather, a keyboard appeared that was not the native iPad keyboard and the whole system locked-up.  I had to reboot the iPad to recover.  Do not bother downloading.",2013-12-12 11:35:36
Great tool!,False,4,CraigsNickname,"My clinic published their ""code"" on the portal home page - that makes it a snap to get hooked up correctly.  This app is a great extension of the functionality of the web portal, and gives me quick access to my info - love it.",2013-07-25 18:37:05
Ren!,False,5,Ren2010,Works great.no problems,2013-11-06 20:39:53

Awesome app!,False,5,Meg175G,"I love the app! Very helpful, quick and easy access to my records: appointments, labs, alerts.No need to remember passwords- just a 4 digit PIN. A lot of features depends on your doc if he decides to release them to the Portal for your access. My doc is awesome so I have all at my fingertips!!!",2013-08-22 12:19:27
New health app,False,1,LalaAG,First time signing on and it will not pull up my MD group and does not have setting to set up your login and password. Getting ready to delete it. THOUGHT it would be helpful...RIGHT! NOT!!!!,2013-08-20 15:42:02

Awesome!!,False,4,Teachergirl64,This app is so much easier than going through the patient portal. You have to have the practice code from your doctor's office to find his/her practice. Mine was on the doctor's website.,2013-06-30 00:59:33
