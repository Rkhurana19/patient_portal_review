0,Nice features but the interface could use some work,False,3,donhessman,"nice features but the interface could use some work. being able to communicate directly with my doctor through the app has been a game changer. being able to see my medical records on the app is amazing!  here are a couple of suggestions though. the messaging feature is a little clunky. unless i access it from the records section of the app, it won’t let me reply to messages. even worse, you have to start over each time on selecting your provider/facility, then your doctor. can we please get the ability to just have that information saved and pre-populated when writing messages until we change it? additionally, it would be really great to be able to share file attachments like images or pdfs.   lastly, i love the feature where you can share fitbit data with your doctor. will we one day be able to also share apple health data? it would be great to able to give my doctor access to data from my apple watch.",2020-01-26 02:02:56
1,Think app needs an update bc of iOS 15,False,2,Pennybink,"think app needs an update bc of ios 15. can login but initially it was not being able to make an appointment and view records. didn’t try sending message via the app as i had no reason to do so. eventually was able to make an appointment. but still trouble login to view records pops up. deleting app and all you should do with an app not responding as it should has not helped. update: been reading other reviews. i had a drive through covid test and because of that, i was in the medical clinics system with healow being available that i didn’t know at the time. later after seeing that place used healow, i was able to use my phone number with some information to get in via a web browser on my computer. can’t recall if i input a password in account there, suspect i did. but do know i did not know my user name from the browser computer version. so the app. frustrating to get in. think i clicked forgot password but do know that i was allowed to use my phone to login and from there saw my user name. no idea if others use firstnamelastnamebirthyear for user name. i wish i could recall when the password was made, likely it was browser version. capital first letter of first name and capital first letter of last name then 19- - birth year and no spaces. this worked for my husband too.",2021-10-05 16:15:45
2,Zero Confidence in Healow,False,1,PJJJK in MA,zero confidence in healow. my health care provider swapped from follow my health to healow. prior to the change i was not too fond of follow my health. since the transition i can honestly say that in my personal experience follow my health is a rock star when compared to healow. i can only assume the “low” in healow stands for low bidder.       i initially gave up after multiple attempts to set up a healo account to access my personal medical records. recently (many months later) i made another attempt which proved just as frustrating and unsuccessful. eventually support was received from my medical providers staff. healow support is in my experience non-existent.         as to the healow app’s content and ease of use. my experience thus far warrants zero stars ! i suspect healow is in the profit business and not the medical records business. this patient’s experience allows healow’s site was definitely not created from a patient’s perspective or needs. their site does not even recognize my primary care provider or the medical practice they service after requesting just that info !      with no intention to create a negative this has thus far been my personal experience. hopefully one that healow will consider to improve their service. if and when they were to make improvements i will post a retraction with a better score. till then  i hope your experience is better than mine.,2022-01-18 20:25:05
3,Nonfunctional app,False,1,TheWallaby,"nonfunctional app. wasted 2 hours trying to set up this app the night before an appointment.  issue is i already had healow installed in prep for a different appointment.  process went fairly smoothly to log into the portal the first time but that appointment is days away.  i have an appointment tomorrow with another provider who unfortunately also requires healow.  app is already installed and nothing works to add a new account from the app (using iphone 11)...finds provider but subsequent prompts just will not accept input.  bailed out and logged in from my newer laptop only to watch it reject every browser i tried (chrome, ie, edge) as “unsupported.”   ended up giving up and logging on using the browser app from my iphone, bypasses the app entirely. at least the test didn’t reject the browser, but it’s really not optimized for the main bike screen.  due to covid risk,i need these virtual visits. guess if it doesn’t work tomorrow with my crazy workaround i’ll cancel my appointment and blame it on eclinicalworks.  i know i won’t be the first to do so. as an it professional in healthcare, i hate seeing buggy apps like these because i know it will be a barrier to healthcare for some non technical or older people. sad.  update:  assuming ecw took the backend down last evening with no alert that maintenance was occurring.  monday am functions like linking an account mysteriously work.  wow.  what a waste of an evening.",2020-04-27 13:25:46
4,Frustratingly bad design,False,1,Real-Pro,"frustratingly bad design. like so many things in the american health care system, this app is a sprawling poorly organized mess, needlessly difficult to navigate and ultimately-give-up frustrating. your incoming messages are on the landing page but how do you get to the thread of received and sent? not from there! and not by clicking on messages either. no, you have to stumble on my records and discover them buried there for some reason. want to renew a prescription? you can do it if you know the secret (as in completely unlabeled) button 5 clicks deep from the main menu. need to tell the app which pharmacy to use? hope it’s not cvs because you will have to manually search through the list of every cvs in the us, randomly listed, screen by screen, until you find your needle in the haystack. and don’t bother seeking advice on how to do this more efficiently: searching help for the word “pharmacy” yields exactly zero results. why would anyone make these boneheaded basic usability decisions? this app is like punishment for actually trying to perform basic healthcare functions online, as if your provider were yelling at you, “just pick up the phone, for god’s sake!”",2021-04-12 12:02:21
5,I can’t rate it any better,False,1,flowerlily1,"i can’t rate it any better. this app is extremely frustrating. i have not been able to log in since december. my doctor’s office has reset it several times to no avail. i keep trying to retrieve/ reset my user name/password only to be told i am not registered. i have received one email from support and even though i explained the above and requested a phone call more than a week ago, nobody has replied. right now my opinion of this app is that plus garbage and customer service none existent.   follow up: today i received an email notifying me that they are considering my case closed. has anyone bothered to contact  me by phone (as i requested) or even by email?  no! and they are closing my case??? unfortunately i can’t give them any lower than a one star. this rating does not necessarily speak for the app. for all i know it’s a great app but i have not been able to use it so i can’t say. my issue is mainly with customer service. i wonder, do they just have bad service? incompetent reps? or are they just so inundated with complaints that they have missed my request?  in any case, this app is useless to me as it stands.",2022-03-31 15:49:26
6,New to Dr Smart... app is an awesome 1st step,False,5,27thLetter,"new to dr smart... app is an awesome 1st step. after the worst transition from a great physician for over 2 years , to what i would say was beyond insulting new estab appt w/a pa yesterday, that was time wasted. the pa 1st stating a well known add med “didn’t exist,”then she “can’t find my history w/ this rx that i’ve been on for 1.5yrs...ergo, not going to refill or even reduce milligram, if that were the true reason she denied to write for 1 refill of an rx taken daily. she refused an antibiotic for severe sinus infection, stating “insurance won’t cover “, yet i have filled it in past w/out a problem? i left after 2 hours, w/ no progress & no refills. an antidepressant & add med taken daily that i’ll be out of next week, leaving me lost.i changed immediately to a dr linked with app, if they care for patients as well as app assists, i will rest easy. it seems they do, we shall see. i have a great feeling about the drs i will be linked to. thank you for a great app.",2019-03-08 18:56:28
7,Works but needs work,False,3,teeblackley,"works but needs work. though i installed this app a couple years ago, i haven’t needed to really use it until recently. how do i delete or even archive “we miss you” or “happy holidays” messages? messages need the option to maintain their thread like in every other messaging app.   i like having a history of my lab and test results and have been able to rely on this feature and is what has kept me using it.    one of my main concerns is readability. the fonts are small, thin and lightweight which makes them difficult to read. i could rely more on the icons (appointments, records, etc) on the main screen if they’re easier to see (small, faint, and detailed). ironically they are easier to see on the help screen! the readability issue applies to every screen.   sadly, i think this app must be one of the lower priced among the options for medical professionals. the version history reflects a lot of bug response, but the last enhancement was 8 months ago and the last update 2 years ago.   the in-app “report a problem” is non-functioning. i question whether the development team even follows reviews/suggestions for improvement or actively works to improve this app. it works, but comes in juuuust under the wire.",2020-10-01 12:42:23
8,No place in medicine,False,1,Zumba*chic,no place in medicine. it’s very simple really. apps have no place in medicine. this is our health we are talking about for which we must rely on yet another device. if something is done such as bloodwork or other tests we should receive a call. my glucose was out of range and rather than call me i had to download this silly app and google what this might mean. i was told it wasn’t alarming because i had not fasted. i wanted to say i have not once in my life been out of range and had only ever once had a fasting glucose test. this is a huge fail on the part of healthcare. impersonal and difficult for older generations. they will miss things. they will confuse people. dr.’s hate it when the general public googles diagnosis and possible health concern scenarios yet they continue to alienate patients. this is just a new way to hold us at arms length. few people know how to read cbc/chem analysis values and an entire generation struggles with the tech. we don’t need this. we need healthcare workers to do what they do best and communicate with us. big thumbs down,2022-04-18 14:06:38
9,Don’t understand what most of you have Against security measures,False,5,SurvivorKym,"don’t understand what most of you have against security measures. i for one like the added measures. if you’ve ever had your identity stolen and your medical information and insurance used and then have to fight for years to clean it up you should be happy that they’re taking these extra subs to protect you so one extra strap may be frustrating but in the long run it could be saving you 1 million other stops. love the doctors love the app and the security. with having stage four bone cancer that is now going to the brain barrier my left orbital socket and plate the extra measures are good for me and i take them every time because i am not having my identity insurance and all of that stolen again so i praise the app, five stars i’d give it 10 if i could",2022-01-05 11:51:45
10,Good but messaging needs improvement,False,4,GP-1970,"good but messaging needs improvement. this app is a well done application that provides good medical record keeping and communication between patient and doctors.   the one issue that is a problem for this application is the messaging. when constructing a message addressed to a doctor, many times an error appears when attempting to send a message, “only valid characters are allowed (a-z, a-z, 0-9), including all special characters“. yet the message does not include any invalid characters or even special characters beyond “)” and “(“ according to the error message.  to work around this error, i have to construct my message in the ios “note” app and then copy/paste the message to the healow app. this is very inconvenient. but i still use this application to communicate with my doctors.",2022-04-11 16:37:37
11,App is not accessible to blind users,False,1,labishop123,"app is not accessible to blind users. i rely on voiceover, a screen reader on apple iphones to use my phone and apps that i download onto it. furthermore, i rely on my doctors health applications so that i can independently review my health information and make informed decisions in my healthcare. with this app, i am having problems accessing my health information, the app refreshes while i am trying to navigate using voice over gestures, and i cannot utilize the messaging feature. in many situations, it has taken me over 30 or 45 minutes to read important information such as my lab results and vitals. it should normally take about 10 or so minutes to do this. i respectfully ask that you make the changes necessary for this application to be compatible with voiceover, as this electronic application is one of the only ways that blind people can independently access their health records.  i thank you for your time and consideration reading this review.",2022-03-24 13:42:32
12,Needs improvement.,False,3,MMMM1011,"needs improvement. i do like the app,but there are improvement that need to be made. for example one of the my most used feature is the messaging. most of the time it’s easier than making a phone call however i can’t see the message until 2 hours after it was sent even if i check the app constantly. if my doctor sent me a message at 3 o’clock i won’t be in my inbox until 5 which is a frustrating inconvenience. it would also be helpful if i could get a notification when i get a message as well.  the telahealth visit through the app is hit or miss and my doctor and i often have to do it another way. if the developers take one thing from this review to fix please fix the messaging lag.",2020-07-30 21:50:25
13,Useless!,False,1,BallisticsGirl,"useless! i use this app for my neurologist. out of all the specialist i see, it’s one of the two most important! i haven’t been able to get an email response from my doctor’s office since 2017 via the app!  what you see on the app: - some of your records.      -you cannot open your lab results, or anything like that though.  - maybe half of your medications that you take from other doctors.  - appointments (this feature i’ve never had trouble with).  - as i mentioned that it’s been two years since i’ve received an email from my doctors office via the app or even to my personal email... i can’t tell if the office is even getting the emails from the program, or if the new mas are even aware of the program! (this makes me miss the people that left office.) or to be honest if my doctor is even aware of the program!  my pharmacy gets notes from my doctor to give to me about seeing him immediately, yet his front desk balks at that notion, so when i try to contact my doctor via the app to let him know... there’s always radio silence.   then to make things worse, you cannot reply to an email thread. it has to be a new email. therefore, no one can keep track of vital information such as seizures or anything of the like!   i wish my office would switch to a more efficient program, or that healow would fix their glitches for the sake of doctors and patients alike.",2019-08-19 15:11:49
14,It’s a useful app when it wants to work,False,2,garbagesquid,"it’s a useful app when it wants to work. i like being able to connect to my doctor without needing to cal and monitor my lab results and medications on here but the app itself is extremely buggy. right now i can’t even log in using my pin, it’ll take me to the home screen and then immediately back to the pin lock screen. after entering my pin again, it’ll tell me an error has occurred.   not only that but messages never load properly, and you cant reply outright to any messages, you have to go in and create a brand new message to send out. the hit points of each button aren’t properly placed so you have to make sure you hit dead center (sometimes not even dead center) in order to click on certain names or access files. this is lack of basic design knowledge.   overall the functionality and the ui design of this app fails in a lot of ways and i feel the only reason why this app even still exists is because it’s a necessity for patients like me to use. that’s not a good business practice at all. you’re doing less than the bare minimum of whats required to have a functional app. whatever bugs you may have fixed generally end up causing more problems.   please hire a team that knows how to integrate functionality into design.",2021-09-23 17:00:48
15,Heading in right direction,False,4,aprilpatt,"heading in right direction. this app has a lot of excellent features, and i especially appreciate the efficiency of communication it allows between me and my children’s pediatrician. i have been using this app for several years now, and the main thing i‘d ask you to improve is the messaging. parents/patients need the ability to reply, and to also see the original sent message. it’s really frustrating to have to completely start over a message each time a response is needed, and to not even be able to refer back to the original/other follow-up messages. ... other than that, the app’s features are really great. love the access to all records, lab reports, health logs, visit summaries, etc. ux is intuitive and simple.",2020-07-06 13:33:56
16,Messaging system is awful,False,1,Tuireann,"messaging system is awful. the app in general feels clunky to use. but the main issue i have is that the messaging system is difficult to keep track of. as far as i can tell, there's no way to see messages you've sent to your providers. similarly, you cannot reply to messages you receive from your providers. the end result is that i can never remind myself what i've already sent to my provider and when, and in every new message response to my providers i have to explicitly reference the context that i'm messaging them about.  simply adding an outbox, and the ability to reply and create essentially ""email threads"" would massively improve this glaring issue. this style of messaging has been around for ages because it works well for most cases. it'd not groundbreaking. that it's not already a basic feature of the application despite it being the year 2022 is absolutely baffling.",2022-04-26 16:08:21
17,Poor interface,False,1,MidCityJB,"poor interface. dealing with medical appointments and test results can be stressful. the healow app test results section looks like someone typed it on an old-school keyboard. unless you are very familiar with medical terms, it is not intuitive. other major providers in my city use the mychart app where in contrast the user interface is a breeze to navigate and visually appealing test results which makes it easy to understand your results. i.e. easy to understand if there is reason to be concerned. the healow app is slow to respond whether you are on wi-fi or the network. when you get notifications via email, the information isn’t in the message on the app. it often says “oops”. sad that a wealthy institution like tulane university in new orleans would use such a poor application. when i expressed my frustration with navigation within the app, staff at the clinic laughed and said “no one uses that app, just email us.”",2021-03-03 03:39:56

19,"Good idea, poor execution",False,1,Zvi Aranoff,"good idea, poor execution. i have this app on my phone because it’s used by my daughter’s pediatricians office. in theory, i could see on it appointments, medical information, communicate with the pediatrician, etc. in reality, however, i find this app to be completely useless. either the problem is with the app itself, or with how it’s linked to my doctor’s website. either way, messages don’t open up, i don’t see appointments, i can get records, etc. basically, it doesn’t do anything it purports to do. for example, i can see on the app that my doctor replied to me, but the messages don’t open up. or they take so long to open, that i get frustrated and just log on directly to my doctor’s website and read it there. as a result, i don’t actually use this app. i check it once in a while, to see if anything changed after an update, but i end up resorting directly to the doctor’s website.",2018-02-08 12:41:23
20,Great concept but hard to use and sometimes dysfunctional,False,3,StealthyKhajiit,"great concept but hard to use and sometimes dysfunctional. i rely on this app to communicate with my doctors quick and effectively and it’s really nice, although sometimes i won’t be able to read emails from my doctor, as it cuts them off and the message won’t expand. when that happens i have to try to copy it and paste it in my notes app to read it.  also, when you try to compose a message and you back out of it, it completely deletes everything and you have to start over. a drafts option would be nice. i do really think that this app could become better with some work and it has potential, but for now i’ll deal with the bugs and irritable occurrences since i need the app lol",2021-02-03 02:06:35
21,No Apple Health Intergration,False,1,Mattl121212,"no apple health intergration. really think this app needs to interface with apple health.  the nature of this app is a digital link to one’s medical providers.  why not connect with ios’s central repository of health information?  no better way to share health data measured outside the office with one’s doctor, and to push vitals from official medical appointments / tests back to apple health.  imo this needs to be integrated to be a great ios app.  less critical, but i would also challenge the dev team to find creative ways to encourage medical offices to use the full features of the healow system; mainly the entering of vitals and test results into the system.  my pc doctors office seems to only use healow for appointments as of now, and i have a feeling others are doing the same.  suggestion above of sharing data with med office from apple health may encourage them to do the same on their end.",2021-02-11 14:41:36

23,Awesome app for those that live long distances from your Dr.,False,4,troyalee,"awesome app for those that live long distances from your dr. i have had pleasure of using the app since it’s inception. just the ability to request prescription refills alone is very accommodating. having your clinical i.e, blood work results at you fingertip, doctors comments and suggestions on improving your healthy life imbalances. doctor patient communication is enhanced allowing doctors to address patients current and possibly additional concerns or issues that he or she may get answers from dr on the portal. access to : heath and prescription records, labs , schedule office visits, get referrals, etc...  i live 4.5 hours away. great time saving , informative app.. believe me not too many medical centers are progressive in their patient come first approach",2018-11-14 04:27:10

25,No point to have app,False,1,Joker Loco 562,no point to have app. can’t communicate with the doctor. can’t reschedule appointment can’t message or see anything. this app is pointless. the doctors office is now closed on fridays. never notified of this can’t reschedule an appointment within 24 hours to avoid extra fees even though i’m trying 4 days in advance. even the app can’t reschedule for you. the only thing you can see on this app is that you have an appointment scheduled. any other things it claims to have as a feature it doesn’t. even messages from the provider are blank. the developer of this app needs to lay off the drugs a bit to make a working app. since the last time there was a issue they claimed to work on it. after the update all they did was delete more features. this is stupid. lay off the crack ok. get your head straight or just delete the app entirely.,2022-01-21 20:32:41
26,Absolutely awesome,False,5,Deafie_b,"absolutely awesome. i like having this option to tell my doctor something that is on my mind that i might forget by the time i go for my appointment.  sometimes it ends up looking like a chapter of a book, but it saves him time when i am there, bc he knows already and is prepared to take care of the problem. if i had not sent a message, i would be in the exam room longer, taking up some time that should be for another patient. i did have a problem with not being able to send bc of commas, etc.  after telling the receptionist at the office she gave me a phone number and i called, got it taken care of and now have no problem.",2019-02-28 17:21:09

71,This app stinks,False,1,BJ 89,this app stinks. first of all you can only use it on an iphone if you use it on a ipad it only goes in vertical mode and it’s tiny and  very hard to navigate.  lab results can only be viewed one item at a time rather than have a print out of a lab report.  i tried to use your contact form and it wouldn’t even let me use apostrophes like in ‘can’t’. i removed all the apostrophes and there was always something wrong. i tried doing it four times and then it said it was timed out- totally ridiculous. thanks for wasting my time.   i hope someone from the company reads this complaint and does something about it because it’s totally useless and i won’t use it again.,2021-07-28 13:25:01

161,Still no  Watch or Health App Support,False,3,MikeBWright,still no  watch or health app support. is it fair to judge this app for a feature it doesn't have?  probably not but this supports several fitness trackers and google health and it's an iphone app that does not support  watch or the health app.  that's disappointing.  i do like that my doctor uses this app and i can interact with my doctor through this app. i hope that one day i'll be able to share my  watch and health app data with my doctor through this app.,2019-02-15 18:09:31
162,Unable Log in,False,1,Las Cruces N.M.,"unable log in. unable to log in. the few times i was able to get into the app was useful being able to see appointments and medications i have been prescribed, but after resetting it for the second time i am still unable to login with new password. when trying to login, the app requires me to set a face recognition or passcode on my phone, which i do not have and do not want to set up and have to unlock my phone every time i use it. with that said i cannot log into the app.. please fix asap",2022-02-18 16:47:01
163,It has the potential to be great…,False,2,Ashlynb421,"it has the potential to be great…. i feel like i’m using the beta version of an app that will eventually be really great. it isn’t user friendly and is very confusing to figure out how to access anything. i can’t figure out how to respond to messages or see test results (two very important things!), and i’m generally a pretty tech savvy person.   keep trying — it’s about time someone come up with a better way to communicate with medical professionals!",2021-11-05 23:13:02
164,Handy app with some very problematic design flaws,False,2,Ætherialx,"handy app with some very problematic design flaws. for a health and wellness app, one would assume that they would take everything into consideration when considering how to present health information to people. like for example, they would think twice about prominently displaying weight under vitals without considering the ramifications for people with eating disorders or body dismorphia. at the end of the day, making appointments and updating your doc and being able to read what they’re saying is very helpful.",2019-11-29 21:22:34
165,Irresponsible and cavalier,False,1,Celeste Cuervo,"irresponsible and cavalier. if you’re going to inject yourself into the process of a patient’s healthcare communications, you should have instant phone support. trying to communicate with a cardiologist shouldn’t be as complex as a moon launch. ill people must not be made to run a gauntlet just to log on . imagine going to a physician for a decade and being told by the retrieval system that the doctor has no record of your existence. imagine trying to deal with this system when you’re ill and being told “we’ll get back to you in 48 hours”. you must find a way to become more competent.",2019-11-27 15:26:07
166,Useful App.  Medication reminders not to par,False,4,Brian H2o,"useful app.  medication reminders not to par. i really appreciate the information this app provides at my fingertips.  test results, medication list, and next appointment are all features that i have appreciated.  i’ve tried a few time to use the medication reminders (notifications on my iphone) and find it buggy and not reliable.  message left for support responded quickly.",2019-07-01 18:37:49
167,Lots of problems,False,3,RobHaight,"lots of problems. unfortunately i have not been impressed.  many issues.  every month it's something. today, every 10 to 15 minutes, i get a notification that i have a new message.  only i don't.  i called my doctor and they said they are hearing from patients that they too are having the same issue.  just what i love, every 15 minutes an alert that isn't.  awesome. not.",2021-03-01 17:43:38
168,Really Disappointed,False,1,railroader1946,"really disappointed. the app can only be accessed by one device at a time. i had to remove it from my phone to access it on my ipad. it is true that the app is only as good as the information entered into it, but if it is as contrary for the physicians as it is for the patient i wouldn’t be shocked if they never entered anything. this is a good idea apparently at it’s first stages of development. make it so i can easily use it on any of my devices, change appointments interactively with the doctor’s system, and communicate with my doctor without having to alter my keyboard habits. i’m tired of writing now.",2018-07-19 15:35:08
169,Terrible. Requires a pin on my own phone!,False,1,rabaid,terrible. requires a pin on my own phone! they only appear to have an ios app. no website for desktop seem to work and my doctor doesn't show up in their site. so i have to use the ios app to login but this requires me to have a separate pin created that must be remembered and used each time.  come on guys get with the 21st century. i have a fingerprint reader in my phone. you remember my password as a configured option but you won't remember my pin as an option and i must type an extra pin!?!!?  that's not added security. that's just annoying.,2017-08-28 19:45:03
170,Great!,False,5,dayannaace,great! tbh the app itself is great. it’s an easy way to communicate with my doctor and easy to make appointments without having to call! it even lets you put a password so no one goes snooping in the app. it also lets you see what medications you’ve been on or are on. 10/10,2022-04-11 04:10:34
171,Good app but needs some work,False,2,Rdrh83,good app but needs some work. hi. just a suggestion.  when you’re sending messages to the doctor. the app could be improved a lot. for example if you are communicating with your doctor in spanish the app does not accept the tildes  that the apple selling dictionary automatically corrects.  this is a little annoying as you need to go back and remove every tilda or special character in the text in order to be able to sent the message.,2021-12-02 15:26:16
172,One of the worst apps I have ever used.,False,1,Sweetcheeks913,one of the worst apps i have ever used. if i could give this zero stars i would. the creators of this app and the website need to do some major updates and modifications. i could go on for several paragraphs about how useless this app is but i will just say although i still use it when necessary to message the dr all it does is upset me. it also disappoints me that a medical practice that encourages all of their patients to use this wouldn’t want to make sure that the app people are counting on to communicate with a physician about their physical well being is user friendly.,2018-05-30 12:49:38
173,Healow is a great way to keep in contact,False,5,Bbbhope,"healow is a great way to keep in contact. i love the healow app, my daughter and my doctor both use this app and you can report to the nurse any changes for the doctor. you can keep up with your medical charts. my daughter's doctor is great about responding on the app, when i have questions. it's just a great app for me to keep up with appointments as well.  i love it!!!",2017-10-18 14:09:22
174,Horrible,False,1,WallyPS,"horrible. i am use to using mychart / epic.   this app does not allow me to upload a photo to the doctor.   if you reply to the doctor, the app can’t figure out that you need it be sent to the author of the email. you have to select the doctor, and facility each time.  composing emails to the doctor don’t allow you to quote previous message texts, and is formatted horribly.  no push notifications when a rx has been sent to the pharmacy.  no push notifications when new lab results are received by the doctor.  doesn’t allow you to manage other users (think elderly parents or children) on their app. you have to go to the web browser which of course uses all different url’s for each provider.  i just wish the doctor would dump this app and go with something that is more robust and functional.",2022-03-16 01:41:04
175,Everything is suddenly gone,False,1,Myjackrulz,everything is suddenly gone. all my doctors offices are gone and i had to start like i was brand new. it can’t find all my doctors and i can’t stand having a passcode to get in. it made me set up a passcode and i can’t turn it off. my only other option is fingerprint and i have a phone that only does face id. this is very annoying when i have appointments this week and this summer and i can’t access my info! both the app and the website won’t let me submit a form for support so this is my only option.,2021-06-07 15:32:18
176,Nice app but quick question,False,4,Reck 1,nice app but quick question. so i’ve had this app on my phone for a year or so and it’s nice and easy to navigate. i also use the apple health app on my watch and phone. from workouts to heart rate and hand washing it’s all in one place. it offers the ability to add hundreds of third party health apps but healow is not available. can we make this happen?,2020-12-29 00:02:25
177,"If I could rate 0, I would.",False,1,Productivity Pro,"if i could rate 0, i would. hours this weekend trying to set up. today(monday) went with the ios app.  the screens are tiny and every time i looked at a lab result, instead of letting me click on the next result it sent me to the home screen again each time.  so much wasted time.  cannot review results over time. very disorganized and confusing. if this is how i will have to communicate with my medical practice, i will have to make a change. i hope i can still call my doctor’s office and talk to a person. so sad.",2021-02-09 00:17:59
178,Very frustrating,False,2,MimiBex Austin TX,"very frustrating. i was asked to set this up for a first visit.  it pulled in my prescriptions but the information on doses is flawed.  some are missing.  all the function given was to accept on hide, no way to edit.  i was told they had all my records but the app didn’t pull any up.  i only hope the office can give me forms to complete or explain.  i hate taking 30 minutes to fill out forms in the office where i may not have access to info.",2021-01-25 04:19:57
179,Dr Figueras & Staff,False,5,Scottish8,dr figueras & staff. you could not ask for a better team of staff for care from the front desk to the back of the office they are all so very kind as soon as you walk in the door.  dr figueras takes his time to listen and takes care of you the way a caring doctor should.  i highly recommend him as my doctor for anyone  who needs care.,2018-09-26 18:47:52
180,Improvement needed,False,3,K-reen,improvement needed. the app is great for that it is but major problem. impossible to contact support. submitting support request will not work and give error message due to their server being down.  then trying to change setting is impossible. i have set my kid to be myself so it set’s me as child and it is impossible to change.  as i said needs major improvements,2021-02-24 16:00:43
181,Wonderful but no notification?!?!,False,4,Criccardo,wonderful but no notification?!?! i wish all of my drs used this app. it really allows me the convenience of contacting my dr without going through the hassle of leaving msgs and waiting or missing a return call. only issue i notice is my iphone doesn’t give a notification when i receive a msg. i’ve missed several important msgs too many days too late.  plz add this in an update!!,2018-03-20 23:51:16
182,Runner9,False,5,23 years,runner9. i think it’s one of the better apps than i had to get you all the information you need it works very well and contact your daughter you can check on your appointments you can check in with your physical therapist it works very well,2022-04-14 23:23:11
183,Fair app could be better,False,3,joelatl,fair app could be better. i like using the app to see the dates of my appointment and ability to check in when arriving.  my meds include the number of refills but do not show the date prescribed for me to know if it’s time to ask for a new prescription.  my physician was surprised when i mentioned it.  i have to use my retail pharmacy’s app for knowing when to request a new script  ahead of time.,2021-08-08 12:03:12
184,Useless,False,1,dlowfly,"useless. i have several doctors in the system with back surgery and throat surgery from 2 surgeons under my belt.  the only thing this app shows is two outdated medications and that is all.  nothing more. no records, labs, appointments, or any other information.  zero.  0.  i could find the same amount of information in my refrigerator or under a rock and i don’t have to spend 30 minutes trying to log into those. next time i need to look at my records i’ll just go look in a tree or ask the guy that lives on the bench across the street.  mmkay?",2018-05-06 04:48:36
185,Happy mom,False,5,Solution ros,happy mom. love this app it helps me keep up with what’s happening with each my children and to keep up with up coming appointments i can see test results and if there is a problem i’m a grateful mom this helps so much with keep me organized with multiple children,2022-04-22 14:46:56
186,Volusia Medical Center,False,3,MeTimeMommy,volusia medical center. i love this app. to bad my doctors office doesn’t care to use it properly. hopefully the developers can see this and contact the new smyrna beach office and help the staff and physicians learn how to use this. in ny the health app was incredible. it helped that the different doctors and staff knew how to receive and send messages. in fl doesn’t seem like they have any interest in learning. my hope is they get some training down here so that the app can be truly appreciated by all.,2018-03-15 13:34:55
187,Only as good as the information supplied by the provider,False,4,Philowell,"only as good as the information supplied by the provider. the pros: all my meds and lab results in one place. ease and portability for use at other drs offices. the cons: labs showed that i needed vaccination booster which i received. dr did not note this in the vaccination section so i could not print that out for my work many of the medications listed were old or only used once eg antibiotics for sinus infection, and i couldn’t update",2019-05-14 12:48:38
188,Messages doesn’t work. Not iPhone X ready,False,1,Mark in SLC,"messages doesn’t work. not iphone x ready. if you send a message over some unknown limit the message fails to send and misreports the error as “special characters are not allowed”. frustrating because i spend my time editing my message down to a single sentence. besides, how hard would it be to use uitextfielddelegate’s “allowcharacters:inrange:” function to prevent malformed characters?  also, apple will soon not allow new apps unless they are iphone x ready, which this one isn’t. that gives you some idea of their commitment to keeping this app fresh.",2018-05-14 23:54:38
189,What's the point?!,False,2,mrs. c@RReR@,"what's the point?! not sure if it's the app or the users but it has nothing in it but appointments. if the doctors are going to recommend something like this it should at least be updated with information. i'm trying to see my kids shot records (which they have) and they're not in there. my son just had a physical about a month ago and none of the stats are present! what the heck? i don't need this app for appointments, i get enough texts and emails to confirm those as a reminder!",2017-05-25 20:53:28
190,Requires microphone and camera access? Awful requirement,False,1,ChristianRiley,"requires microphone and camera access? awful requirement. talk about a bad design decision requiring both microphone and camera access to get into the app even though you were only using it to access records from your provider. sure, if we want to do tele visits, i can see it, but they only use it for records and i am not giving an app access when i don’t have to do so. rethink that please.  also the codes needed and not pulling info from the practice makes this a bad overall experience",2022-01-10 23:32:59
191,Multiple users,False,3,Gutek123,"multiple users. in order to switch between users in my case i have two children, i have to log out and sign back in with credentials. i wish you had within application an option to switch between users. just find it annoying to log back in each time. hope this will be a next improvement on this application. thank you.",2019-05-14 22:30:40
192,Useless,False,2,Inspector Gadget 2324,"useless. this could be a great app but it it obvious the developers launched this way to early.  the only option that worked for me was to see my appointment.  entered medication but there is no way, that i can find, to delete or correct a previously enter med.  entered notes and they disappeared.   tried to sign in with my ipad and the app  indicated i entered the wrong information which i did not.  interestingly the same process (wrong information) occurred when i first tried the app on my iphone.",2017-08-19 11:12:54
193,Worse developers ever,False,1,Nosequepasochiko,worse developers ever. website is bad app is even worse can't even login this is obviously from an iphone the webpage doesn't allow me to login through safari only on chrome web browser in addition the app doesn't allow me to login because all i could do is search for a provider and mines is not even on the app but through google chrome i was able to access my account and retrieve my information shame on you for delivering such a horrible product for something as important as medical records,2017-07-03 13:27:40
194,Nowhere near as useful as the web portals,False,2,Altcatred,"nowhere near as useful as the web portals. in theory this could be super useful. in reality all i ever use this for is to check when i have appointments. messaging providers through this app is severely restricted compared to when i message my drs or pas through the web portal. it’s practically useless. the records section has admittedly gotten better than when i first downloaded the app, but honestly i find the messaging so annoying i hardly use this anymore.",2021-11-28 23:51:06

I wouldn't advise usage.",False,2,Mr Kylhappy,"um, ...no. i wouldn't advise usage. i'm being totally fair and candid about my feelings for this app. but not just mine, i'm putting in a word for my current doctor( whom i will not name ). and just by my layperson's viewpoint of how well both of us felt at the time of my appointment, i'll come right to the point, we had a terrible time with the overall usage of your app. i've got other issues that make further usage of your app, by me, incredibly impossible.",2020-10-08 03:17:53
196,Emailed for help,False,5,Itsdaybyday,emailed for help. i was having trouble with my app so i sent them an email asking for help. not only did i get a reply but after a few emails back and forth got the problem resolved. it was an awesome and amazing to get the help i needed. i have deleted so many apps because there was no help.  thanks for such a great app.  its day by day maureen 💔👼💜💈⛳🐿😜🤟🏻,2019-09-25 18:37:27
197,Interesting.,False,5,AndyMunozSLC,"interesting. it’s an interesting way to find out if you have an std or not, the suspense of scrolling and swiping left to right to reveal wether you have some crazy disease is fun! luckily nothing crazy came back positive, but imagine finding out you’re knocking on death’s door by using this app, before the doctor has time to call you. lol.",2018-03-24 13:45:02
198,Clunky and not user friendly,False,1,The_Dana,"clunky and not user friendly. i wanted this to be more useful than it has been. it requires me to log in multiple users (my son and i), and claims it’s possible, but after linking the accounts several times, it doesn’t show up under the “other users”. i just get caught in a circle of misery trying to link them. you can’t submit a question to the company without being a doctor/provider so you’re just stuck dealing with its crappy ui on your own. not a fan.",2022-03-29 18:07:56
199,Undo latest update,False,1,Ryan_nicole,"undo latest update. i don’t know what kind of update healow recently did but y’all need to undo it. i’ve never had a passcode for my phone and because of that it now won’t allow me into the app. i’ve never had an issue with it until now. i should not have to have a phone passcode to get into an app that is already passcode protected. my review is a review on the update. as far as the actual app goes, it’s good and useful but now i can’t access it because i don’t have a phone password. stupid.",2021-11-13 00:31:19
200,Passcode,False,3,kpajulie,passcode. i agree with those who are frustrated because a passcode is now required for your device.  i do understand privacy issues but feel it invades my privacy when i have to set something up on my ipad and iphone that personally i have chosen not to use for years.  please return to just a passcode or fingerprint for app access without the device passcode.,2021-12-04 18:36:52
201,Simplify,False,5,Tired Lucy,"simplify. very helpful app. i can email the doctor and get an answer quickly. saves a lot of time and phone calls, and the worst, waiting for a return call that you might miss. you have all your prescriptions on your phone with the correct spelling! handy when you’re at another doctors office.",2018-10-04 06:23:52
202,Useless Ap,False,1,lucycmhmi,useless ap. this ap is useless and unsure why i even needed to upload it. i was told it would have everything i need at my fingertips. waste of time.   my medical history is incomplete: missing my vaccines and at least 9 out of 10 years visit history and lab work history. also there is no  billing section for me to keep everything straight. i don’t want one portal for billing and one for health. too many log ins to keep track of.   the idea was good but the execution is poor.,2022-01-25 18:05:32
203,Great app!,False,5,Mrs.Hölljes,great app! i really appreciate being able to communicate with my doctor via the message center. i am unable to speak on the phone due to a voice disorder and this app allows me to reach out to my doctors without having to ask someone to call for me or drive there in person!,2019-02-15 16:42:54

206,No bill pay feature on my app… clunky and not user friendly.,False,3,dunn85,no bill pay feature on my app… clunky and not user friendly. i personally use this and so do my patients and no one likes it. half the time ask the paperwork you fill out on it won’t translate to the system and half the people just plain can’t use it. only thing i like is that i can message the dr. directly and the lab notifications.,2022-03-01 13:19:59

208,Horrible App,False,1,kyleh24,horrible app. this is the worst app ever! it never functions as it should and it is designed horribly. it's nearly impossible to find what you're looking for and it is so buggy. i used to be able to view certain kinds of test results but can no longer do so with this version! that's kind of annoying to say the least. trying to message the doctor and view sent messages is a joke. a health app that is important for communication with your doctor should really be designed a lot better!,2017-05-24 03:34:48
209,Worthless waste of time.,False,1,Texaswise,"worthless waste of time. this app gets totally screwed up when you have more than one of yours doctors’ practices that use it.  even though the second practice shows up in the app, i get a login error when i select it - even after i enter my pin.  i plan on letting my health care providers know that i refuse to use this garbage app.  if they can’t handle that i’ll find another health provider.  if i could rate this app lower than one star i certainly should.  it should get negative stars.",2022-03-18 14:37:32

212,Still too many bugs,False,3,KA572917647/8,still too many bugs. the app allows you to see test results when they’re ready but it’s functionality is very spotty. trying to add a second child to the account is impossible.   the icons often don’t work and it’s impossible to navigate around. it would have been faster to just call the dr for the results.,2020-10-20 19:33:07
213,Payments,False,1,Nothere2,payments. difficult to use the app for multiple reasons. i was required to use it for the last 2 years and thankfully my doctor is going to another system. i just paid my last bill.  the billing part of this system is the worst part because the forms don’t appear completely. i won’t have to worry anymore about spending an hour clicking on blank parts of the buggy pages to process a single payment.,2022-02-02 01:40:59

App maker should be ashamed.,False,1,Paulski,"awful app! app maker should be ashamed. i’ve been attempting to message with my doctor on this app only to find out that: 1)you cannot see the full response/message. i discovered that by copying the text and pasting it into a new massage would show text which is not visible when the message is open in the inbox 2)there appears to be no ability to reply directly to messages, meaning if i want to reply to my doctor i have to start a new email string  also the app design is ridiculously dated. not certain who’s grandparent designed the app but it is in dire need of a refresh.   the makers of this app should be ashamed of what they’ve created. i hope they’ll correct these issues soon but in the meantime i will seek out other ways of communicating with my doctor.",2021-02-26 21:02:16

Dickson,"seems promising, needs healthkit support. as far as the basics — viewing health records, checking appointments, etc., the app seems to work as expected. however, it’s disappointing that it can’t pull or push data to the health app, which is the central repository for all health data on any iphone. i’ve got a wealth of data being generated by the phone itself, and by my watch, and healow can’t feed it to my providers at all.",2017-10-03 13:22:08

236,Messages are awful and notifications don’t work,False,2,UltramaticXY,messages are awful and notifications don’t work. using this app to communicate with your provider is an exercise in frustration. messages aren’t threaded and the message composition will not allow special characters like apostrophes. also there is something wrong with message notifications. i have notifications turned on but i’ve missed several messages from my doctor since you don’t get notified.,2018-11-30 01:30:25

244,Missing facts,False,1,Disappointed Dolphin,missing facts. i just read the developers remarks about the app. the remarks failed to mention that in order to use this app you must set up a passcode to enslave your phone. now another problem has been introduced. for the people who already have a phone passcode; no problem. for those who have to set up a passcode that now controls your phone; it seems like a lot of over kill. so not using this app till this problem is gone,2022-02-26 15:46:44
245,Decent app,False,3,rozell78,decent app. the app is decent.  two issues i’m experiencing.  1.  the visit summaries won’t load in the app.  it says “an error occurred”.  the visit summaries do load via the website.  2.  lab result notifications are sporadic at best.  sometimes i get an email a few days after they’ve been released.  why not a push notification or immediate email when the doctor releases the results?,2019-09-16 02:00:10

Difficult to read,False,2,Pitbull928,print is too small and light!!! difficult to read. i am not happy with this new update. what i don’t like about this new update which i was forced to download is that the letters are smaller and lighter than before so it makes it very difficult to read. i have to now struggle to read my results. i get that these developers want it to look aesthetically pleasing but they forgot about their audience and missed the mark on functionality!!!,2019-07-04 13:40:13

1752,Uselessly incomprehensible,False,1,Freeport Mainer,"uselessly incomprehensible. the graphic design of the healow iphone app has rendered it entirely incomprehensible and nearly useless.  it is chock full of unlabelled, cryptic, infinitesimally small, hieroglyphic icons, utterly devoid of all meaning, unless you happen to have your junior g-man secret decoder ring handy.   so, if you’ve been asked to confirm your medical appointment, you go to appointments, right?  but once you find your appointment, which one of the four icons are you supposed to click?   so the first one sorta looks like a heart with a hole in the middle, but my appointment’s with a dermatologist and i’m pretty sure he doesn’t treat cardiology problems, so maybe this is a map pointer?  i don’t see how i can confirm my appointment by going to a map.   the second icon has these tiny little rectangles with even smaller stuff inside each one.  (why did i leave my electron microscope at home?)  wait!  i’ve got it!  it’s so obvious!  it can’t be anything other than an excel spreadsheet reduced to 0.003%!!!! the next icon is unequivocally clear.  it’s a telephone.  ok, so click here to call the office secretary to confirm your appointment.  so why didn’t they just say that in the email?  what’s the point of going to the app? and i know what the last one is!  that icon is an eye!  that was easy, but what’s that supposed to mean?  “your dermatologist wants you to stop wasting his time, because what you really need is an ophthalmologist!”  or maybe you click the eye to have a video facetime call with the appointment secretary instead of a simple phone call?  or maybe it’s the icon to confirm you’re ready to “see” the doctor at the appointed time?  or maybe you click the eye to say you can’t make it to the office for a face-to-face visit, but you’d like to request a dermatological telehealth video examination, instead?  i give up! i’ve seen lots of really bad user interfaces, before, but, without exaggeration, this one may very well be the worst.   some uis are ugly, some uis are clunky, some uis require an unnecessary string of multiple steps to accomplish what ought to be a simple one-click task, but i’ve never encountered one (even for complex highly technical applications) that was so impossible to understand.   granted, the graphic design looks pretty.  it’s got tons of uncluttered white space.  but if i want to see pretty design, i can go look at the annual aigi awards.  the fundamental hallmark of good graphic design is clear communication.  this design is a hallmark of irritating failure.",2020-02-26 16:39:20

1770,Waste of Time,False,1,PrincessPunzee,"waste of time. this app has yet to work in several months. somehow i was signed out of my account, but it still has certain pieces of information from that provider. when i try doing a search to locate my provider and sign back in, it gives me a field to type in a name, but that field will then disappear and switch to a different field! once i get past that madness, i have to login. of course, i didn't remember my login or password. first i asked the app to send me my password via text, and it's been 20 minutes and i still haven't received a text. i then requested it by email and received it immediately. then i tried logging in. let me go back a bit to explain that with each password attempt, the screen performed the classic ""loading please wait"" gesture and quickly ended with me still looking at the login screen. i thought it was because my password attempts were wrong, but the screen didn't say that either. after resetting the password and successfully entering it, the system still did not recognize i was trying to login. until now, i am still unable to access my account through this app. i would like them to take another look at what's going on with this app because it's completely useless to me except for to look up the 2 one-time doses of medication i received two years ago from what looks like an unknown source (since i still can't login to my providers account and it doesn't give that information with what i currently can't see).",2017-03-16 14:33:46
1771,Horrible Software and Support,False,1,SMTIPS,"horrible software and support. my doctor uses the software from healow, that has gross mis-formatting in their appointment reminder emails. it seems that it's more important for the software maker to have a big banner ad for themselves at the bottom of the emails than the appointment reminder text to be correctly formatted (the entire line that the address, location, and time is on has no spaces at all, it looks sorely stupid). i emailed healow to tell them i'm concerned that the emails sent look so unprofessional as to be laughable. the response was a curt, rude answer that they only make the software and that they don't control how people use it and i should call my doctor's office...yet half the email is an ad from them! and yes, it sends a callback to the software company via the graphic load in the email. obviously they’re more interested in advertising than in providing a decent software or training the staff on how to properly use the tool. i bet they are soaking doctors for a bundle, and the sad part is, that most (probly 99%) recipients won't ever let anyone know how unprofessional it makes the doctor look.",2014-08-01 21:42:18

1778,Has Potential But Disappointing,False,1,K-HAWKER,"has potential but disappointing. i tried this app because my cardiologist uses the software.  it's a great idea and the description makes one think it is just what you want.  apparently there is no support staff for the app.    i can't sync with my fitbit charge hr.  it does not connect with the microsoft health vault or the ms band.  it does not connect to myfitnespal, garmin connect or apple health.  connectivity is everything for an app that is supposed to save you time by avoiding entering data by hand.  signing up the medical professionals is great but that is only half of the picture.  the patients need to be addressed also. people are not going to drag a laptop to the doctors office when they have a $600 smartphone in their pocket and they are not going to key fitness data when they have bluetooth fitness trackers.  hopefully the owners of this system will get with the program, make a lot of improvements and this will become a ""go to"" app.",2015-03-24 02:57:50
1779,Pathetic Application,False,1,WalkTester,"pathetic application. this goes from bad to worse.  after 5 days back and forth on email the app finally asked me to set a pin.  i entered a 4 digit pin and that was all i could do.  it did not accept it or open up any other avenue of choice.  i could backspace or type over the entered digits.  i tried scrolling down, up left, right - nothing hidden out of sight just stuck there.  i closed it.  now a day later i tapped the app and i get the same screen but with the addition of forgot pin, and incorrect pin once i had entered the pin,  had tried so hard to register the previous day.  the screen wobbled and said i had an incorrect pin.  i tried several times but always incorrect!  next i tried the ""forgot pin""   option.  it suggested i go to my patient portal and retrieve the pin there.  as i've never entered or been asked for a pin in my patient portal, not surprisingly it has no record of one. hopeless!",2014-09-09 14:30:30

1781,"So near, yet so far",False,3,MAC353535,"so near, yet so far. certainly the app is better than the previous method of contact the doctor's office; however, there are still some major items missing.  first, there is no history of emails sent.  second, there is no way to get notification that emails are waiting to be read (i do not look at this app on a regular basis, so getting a notification sent to my personal email address that a ""message is waiting"" would be a terrific feature!).  finally, if there was a way to store medical history and doctor's notes, the site would be much more useful.",2017-01-04 22:03:04
1782,Decent app!,False,4,TobeyNator,"decent app! the app is a great companion to our pediatrician's patient portal- however, its usefulness depends on what information the pediatrician makes available. for example, for one of our children we can see stats like weight and height and for the other child we can't.  there's some room for improvement- navigation is awkward in the my records section- a summary/consolidated information section would be nice in order to reduce the number of taps it takes to get to certain information.  the switching between multiple children should be possible from anywhere in the app without having to return to the home screen.",2013-06-15 15:16:17
1783,This tool is exactly what I needed!,False,5,Rick Hankins,"this tool is exactly what i needed! i was shocked to see so much  dissatisfaction in a great app.  e-clinical is a pc software that houses your records for you to peruse whenever.  healow takes the data from e-clinical and organizes it into their streamlined interface.  for example, when i had a physical this week, i told the nurse that i was now taking a new non-prescription 'drug'. i gave her the name and when she put it in her system, it appeared in healow within minutes.  there are so many other advantages, but the best for me is that i always carry around my medical record just  i'm case there is an emergency.",2014-01-24 17:03:16

1786,What a disaster,False,1,VanillaShake,"what a disaster. if all you need is to read secure messages from your doctor, then sure -- the app will be useful for you. but for the remaining 90% of the advertised features, it's a joke. activity tracking is completely non-functional. i have several withings devices plus an apple watch and a misfit. the app doesn't use healthkit so it doesn't track the vast amount of activity information available from the iphone m7, or the apple watch. and although i linked it to my withings account, this app has yet to register any activity from those withings devices.   it would seem that most of the app is web-based, not native ios. it's very slow to navigate and looks clunky. in all its not a good user experience and its issues are too annoying for me.",2015-08-12 14:17:17
1787,Extremely clunky .. Broken password validation,False,2,Firepoet,extremely clunky .. broken password validation. when first setting up an account the app asks for your original password and dob or phone number. using a password database this process is literally impossible. i need to go back and forth between apps to generate an extremely secure password using lastpass. at the end of the three screen process the app says my randomly generated 18 character password with letters numbers and special characters is too weak. so i go try and figure out what its pattern is. trouble is.. each time i try i have to go back to the beginning. i still haven't figured out the pattern it wants.  so i gave up trying to use the app. what a terrible experience!,2016-05-01 12:07:11

1810,Works really well,False,4,FloridaTrish,works really well. i just downloaded this app to send a note to my provider. setup was effortless and the portal opened immediately with all options available. it sent my note and the entire note was visible on my phone. i would have given 5 stars but have not tried all options. as for reviewers complaining about full screen not visible-that would not bother me. i would simply scroll. nice to have app on mobile device.,2016-01-06 14:48:54
1811,A little better than nothing,False,2,SiNoSiSiNo,"a little better than nothing. you don't get much of a choice with this app, either your doctor uses it or he doesn't. there is so much potential for an online portal with access to your medical records, test results, appointment scheduling, and messaging with your doctor, etc. unfortunately, healow is a mess. it's unreliable, it has a crappy interface, it's tedious to get info out of it when that feature is even working, and tech support is a minimum of two days for every response. this app needs a ground up redo. doctors should look elsewhere.",2017-02-05 05:15:07

1822,poor basic usability,False,1,BusyBee3,"poor basic usability. i had to get this app to connect my kids with their pediatrician.  now the app thinks i am my kids, and adding a new account for my provider didn't work - i had to go to the web site to log in and make sure everything was set up properly.  navigation is confusing.  paranoid security protocols prevent copying and pasting a password from my phone password manager.  just switching to another app and back ignores the benefit of apple multitasking and causes the app to reset so i have to log in from the beginning each time. just a lousy experience.",2016-09-23 16:14:11

1825,App,False,2,Kaeden68,app. too difficult to add multiple doctors in the app within the roper saint francis system. after i added one doctor it was impossible to add another doctor within the rapper system using either their name or numbers in digits system. when it works it's great for keeping me updated on my appointments and that's about it. there should be a way for me to press send a doctors name and push add once i'm in my own account. when i asked questions on this no one seems to know what i'm even talking about. no what ever department i ask.,2017-04-18 02:44:52

1880,Great start but needs an upgrade to messenger service,False,3,William Strange,"great start but needs an upgrade to messenger service. when corresponding with docs, reply to message doesn't seem to be an option.  which means, you have to start a new message string just to respond.  also, the summary of lab results could use a face lift.  overall, good app and ahead of its time.  the medical industry needs someone to innovate like this app has done.",2017-01-08 02:15:50

1885,Lost,False,1,Frstr8ted,lost. this app offers you to create a pin but does not confirm the pin no way to come away from the screen without closing the app. when you open the app it ask for the pin that was never confirmed. so you cant get in thru the app. then it tells you to reset your pin at the website but no where on the website does it address the pin number. make sure before you put out an app that you at least test the security /log in features.,2014-04-15 11:17:25

1888,Desperately needs an update,False,2,fitguy2012,desperately needs an update. this app has great potential but really needs some updating. the developers really need to get serious about making the app work for patients and their doctors.   despite a few minor speed improvements the app is still the clunky old interface it was a year ago when i gave it two stars  it still just seems like it's in the beta phase,2016-12-22 12:59:48

1896,recent update killed the app,False,2,anniechan,recent update killed the app. it wasn't great but also wasn't that bad before the resent ios update. it's no longer working on my 5s. ui could use a makeover. in general i thought it was convenient for appointment records and lab test results viewing. helpful when i could manage multiple family members and their accounts from different clinics on one single device. please fix this app.,2015-11-18 15:02:30

1898,Limited Usefulness - Content Has to be Shared,False,2,SoCal Jay,"limited usefulness - content has to be shared. the app works as intended, but is limited by what the doctors choose to share.  the summaries are uninformative, lab results aren't shared.  a week after an appointment is completed the only thing shared is that (it's done).    usefulness only comes with sharing of content.   if it's not shared then the app is useless.  the app provider needs to work better with the medical community to make the app effective.",2015-11-15 15:23:55

2600,Good app; could be better,False,4,davidhanddotnet,"good app; could be better. i like this app, but it could be significantly better with a few improvements.  test results: the my records area, in particular, could use some help. to begin with, since it primarily aggregates test results, why not instead label it ""test results""?  the formatting of the test results display is poor and difficult to read compared to the desktop browser version, and it would be useful to make the abbreviations and acronyms in the left-most column clickable links to brief explanations of what they mean — perhaps including sub-links to more detailed explanations from some authoritative source.  finally, i'm not sure if the arrival of new test results can optionally generate a notification on the phone's home screen or not (i've not noticed that they have), but if not, they should. so that users don't have to continually open the app and tap in their passcode just to see if new test results have been posted.  messages: it's frustrating that the messages area only displays incoming messages (the desktop browser interface displays both incoming and outgoing messages), so it's necessary to screenshot or cut-and-paste outgoing messages to create a record of them on the phone. permitting the display of only one side of a conversation seems likely to needlessly generate confusion and repetition.  and while we're on the subject, an indication that an outgoing message has been read would be useful in communicating the status of a conversation.  passcode: it would be great if tapping in the passcode would keep the app open and accessible until the phone is locked, even if it's necessary to go to another app and then return. because the abbreviations and acronyms used in test results are undefined, as noted above, it's necessary for non-medical professionals to go back and forth to google, for example, for help in understanding them. currently, each and every time users return to the app, it's necessary to tap in the passcode again. health data security is of course extremely important from the standpoint of hipaa, and for other reasons, but this feels like pointlessly time-consuming excess, and it's frustrating.",2016-10-13 16:23:54

2837,One of THE Sorriest Apps I’ve Ever Used,False,1,gclunsf,"one of the sorriest apps i’ve ever used. i’m retired with about 40 years of computing experience and about 6-7 years of iphone & ipad app user experience. i can tell you, up-front, this is one frustrating, poorly designed, sorriest excuse for an app i’ve had the misfortune to use to-date. here’s the problems:  1) constructing a new strong account password the app will accept should not be the “rocket science” it seems to be. the password guidelines, some of which they supply on their web portal, are shown nowhere on the app screen where the new password has to be supplied. showing all the guidelines is a common practice among most apps that handle input of of new passwords. attempting to set a password for a new additional account under healow seems next to impossible. it rejects them with a “new password is very weak” message no matter how strong the password really is.  2) once the user has started the process of adding a new account to healow, any action by the user in navigating to another app before finishing the new account add  will result in the healow app discarding all the information the user has input and take them back to a screen requesting their pin code when going into settings. why would a user navigate to another app while doing the new account add? i did it to refer to information needed for the new app addition process, such as the medical practice’s code and the userid and temporary password supplied by the medical organization, for example. i cannot say how absolutely frustrating and ridiculous this is and would be, especially, to inexperienced users. on this problem, alone, i give the app a “1-star” rating out of 5 stars. it shows exceedingly poor design and even poorer testing practices.  3) when adding an account by hitting the “+” in the upper right corner of the my accounts screen, a screen is brought up in which the user should be able to search by the provider name, practice name, or practice code. however, when that screen is brought up, the app often proceeds beyond it to a list of provider names & addresses as might be useful if the user wants to search by provider name. however, no provider name has been supplied. getting the screen to stop and allow the user to instead provide a practice name or practice code, as is my case, depends on the user trying to tap the screen in several places across several iterations. again, this is the result of exceedingly poor design and poorer testing practices.  4) customer support is nearly non-existent for this app. i’ve gone back and forth with these folks about 3 times to try to resolve the password problem. they finally said to just contact the medical provider whose account i’m trying to add, and they’ll work it with them. that medical provider isn’t having the problem. i am. this demonstrates their unwillingness to work with their customers to fix problems.  whatever you do, if you can, avoid this app like the plague!",2018-02-27 21:33:12
