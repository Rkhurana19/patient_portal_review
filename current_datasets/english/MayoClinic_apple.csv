0,A pretty easy and inclusive app… except for ONE thing,4,False,"a pretty easy and inclusive app… except for one thing. this app is amazing in that you can set up appointments, see your appointment schedule, see your lab results and even converse with your medical team. it is failing in one aspect for me that would put it over the top: including a way to add appointments into ones own ical, google, hotmail, yahoo, whatever calendar without them having to do so manually. for a patient such as myself, when i have a full days worth of appointments, i’d like to be able to transfer it into my own calendar seamlessly so i may schedule work/events around it. as of now i’m having to add a full days worth of appointments (more than 7) individually and manually instead of it just syncing up or copying to my calendar. if you can add this feature, that would be amazing- thank you!",Nikkideez,2021-09-13 21:17:25,nan,nan,nan
1,Navigating the Mayo system,3,False,navigating the mayo system. i love mayo and we have been with it since we lived in minnesota. but once we moved to scottsdale we could not move our primary care doctor here to mayo in that we were over 65. that was a low blow after being with mayo in rochester and having all of our medical care there for years. the other thing i find is that the mayo system is difficult to navigate. until you’re the one doing all of the navigating you don’t realize the difficulty involved. because they do not take medicare you have to pay the bills and never seem to match the payment schedule and so i put an xl spreadsheet together and put took it to the finance department. he told me that it is impossible to use the spreadsheet to figure out pay and even he had difficulty explaining it to me. that being said i still think it’s the finest medical facility in arizona but it certainly is difficult to navigate. on the website i find that if you request a response from the medical team you will get a quick response. i also find they telemedicine more and not being able to meet with doctors. i also find that pas and mps are meeting with you rather than doctors more often. i find them taking extraordinary covid precautions and felt very safe once i got into the facility.,kayaklafy,2020-07-17 16:48:47,nan,nan,nan
2,World’s Best Healthcare,5,False,"world’s best healthcare. we return each year to mayo for our annual physicals, and we always have a nice experience considering the reason we are in rochester. we find the doctors, nurses, and staff so helpful, kind and wonderful in their care for my husband and me. it is the best care one could find! though we spend our winters in scottsdale and knowing there is a mayo’s there, we still favor having the physicals in rochester. through the years we have had other family members needing surgery and mayo was our choice to go and again we were very pleased with the remarkable help from the doctors, nurses and staff we received. our biggest disappointment was finding that my doctor of 15 years is apt to retire next year.  he has been the best and i’ve especially appreciated the wonderful care he has given. he has been so helpful and does his work well and gives us the impression he has all the time in the world for us even though we know it is not true. we were sorry to hear this as he will be greatly missed by us. i have greatly appreciated having him for my doctor.",nana Ava,2020-10-23 16:58:56,nan,nan,nan
3,Good start but needs work!,2,False,"good start but needs work! sometimes it opens, often it doesn’t. as i am legally blind, it’s hard for me to read the info. in particular, the patient number is written so small i have to give it to others to ask them to read it. (so much for patient confidentiality- i’d rather they just leave it so i can enlarge it. (i need minimum font size 14 to read but normally use 18 to avoid strain- i believe yours is about 8). color change would help as well. i can change my ipad to go white on black nos like this note, but cannot change the app background. these things have caused great issue problems for me including overpayment by me which mayo clinic still has not resolved. if i had been able to read the note, it would have been avoided completely.   set up doesn’t allow for patients to put their own notes - something which would allow better exchange with doctors as things come up between visits, it also (like most medical portals) doesn’t allow for information exchange by the patient with other non-mayo doctors. until doctors demand that portals be able to exchange info, medical treatment in this country will continue to erode. you are in a good position to do so. use the reputation of mayo clinic under the mayo brothers and demand better for your patients!",LadyCharlane,2020-01-15 21:12:25,nan,nan,nan
4,Some features great and others poor,3,True,some features great and others poor. this app is very handy and i use it frequently. like adding appointments to calendar feature. but both website and app neglect the ability to pay by visit selectively. this means bills get much later payment while some are pending on insurance payments...this is bad for mayo cashflow.  i might add that each time i have called and paid by specific visits the mayo clerk agrees that they get many callers requesting to pay in this manner yet nothing has been done about it. one would think that the operating costs associated with phone support for billing in this manner (many times it can be 10+ minutes) would easily justify the changes to incorporated it. for example the website already lists the bills by visit number yet it does not provide the means to pay them individually. so this is just not an app problem.  i suspect the problem is that they do accounting of charges and credits by an account and not by individual bills to an account. but since they go through the effort to address bills individually they should have the means to implement payment by bill(visits).,Matenai,2018-08-14 00:19:21,Matenai - thanks for the kind words about the app.  I’ve passed your feedback along to our billing area so they can consider improving that experience for users in the future.

5,"For me, they need to be more direct.",3,False,"for me, they need to be more direct. while i highly recommend this app/site, and have often go gone to it as a first source of information for medical issues, for me, they pull too many punches.     if you want a more direct, and quite possibly more emotionally challenging take on a medical issues, i highly recommend the medscape app.       having said that, i have a lot of respect for this app. it’s a very good entry point for basic medical information. kindness, and patient empathy, are very important. and many people people are not comfortable with more direct clinical information.     as an example, if you ever are faced with a serious medical situation, and a doctor recommends an invasive treatment, ask them not just what the odds of success and failure (death) are. ask them what the success, failure and morbidity are. morbidity is often a big slice of the pie, and that means that the physicians tried, and actually made things worse. asking about morbidity will change the nature of the conversation with the medical community.     to spin off of the wizard of oz, don’t ignore the man behind the curtain.",EV-traveler,2019-05-31 17:04:28,nan,nan,nan
6,Review #2 of: “A Godsend for chronic patients!!”,5,False,"review #2 of: “a godsend for chronic patients!!”. i still feel the same way i did when i rated 3 years ago, absolutely have no idea how i was able to navigate my own health care i since then this app has taken full advantage of the ever increasing capabilities of cellular phones. there are several new ways it’s made the patients feel more in control of our own health care direction and decisions. off the top of my head some new capabilities are: faster and simpler ways to communicate with drs, i can schedule and cancel appointments online with very little to no need to speak with anyone, i can be contacted by my drs and/or their nurse(s) when they need to reach me, ex. to add to something we discussed at an earlier appt, etc.. just makes me feel more confident and in control, which is priceless when 1 or several health problems seem to take that control away.",Baijley,2021-04-14 06:28:58,nan,nan,nan
7,MAYO KNOWS APPS! THIS IS GREAT!,5,False,mayo knows apps! this is great! the best and most useful app of all! and if there’s a glitch they don’t waste time fixing it!!!! they continually surveil it and check for proper operation. it’s a dang good virtual tool for all health needs & keeping in touch with your care team. billing information and payment ability (even the option to set up payment plans) is right there too! this is the best and well-maintained app in the store!!!!!  ps... you can also contact their tech team directly via phone! that is sure different and comforting. they truly care!!!! all apps should be so wonderful! apple should mandate this type service with all its apps allowed on their app store!!!!! unfortunately they don’t seem to care except to collect their share…we all know how impossible it is to get any tech support with most every app that apple allows to be available on their store!!!,TITANIUMPATRIOT,2022-01-20 07:08:42,nan,nan,nan
8,Was a useful app,1,False,"was a useful app. getting past and reporting bugs is impossible. if a person is expected to use an app provided to access and report bugs and app issues, there should be an open line to it to report bugs and issues and not some roadblock. i have done all possible troubleshooting steps i can and still cannot access the app's reporting feature…thus forcing this change in rating. if they were simple issues i wouldn't bother complaining. however, when the app makes it impossible to take surveys, report dates and send bug reports there is a significant issue.  old review: i've recently started using the app. the set up wasn't easy at first (numbers! i hate punching numbers) but after i got logged in and working it has been a champ. a trip to the er with the app helped me keep abreast of my lab results and allowed me ask the physician good questions about my health and results. there is always room for improvement, like definitions, etc. however, after my initial hassle, this app has been very useful to me when i needed it...thankfully, not often.",books54751,2021-12-28 18:15:32,nan,nan,nan
9,Autoimmune diseases,5,False,"autoimmune diseases. i am a physician . i am retired. due to severe  symptom’s of pain in my hands.  then it went into my feet.  i have always exercised.  i was a gold medal winner at age 6 in a national aau  swim meet, which was part of a five state division, montana, minnesota, nd and sd.  i graduated from the u minn in mpls.  i went on , as an adult to long distance running and 3x a week of weight lifting.  i then got into joseph pilates for 15 years until my instructor moved  back to seattle.  i also took vigorous and demanding yoga classes.  ashstanga, other yoga that extremely demanding.  i went through a year course to train to be a yoga instructor.  then i took an 18month course to learn accupuncture and chinese medicine.  yet, i am now at a point where walking is a challenge  due to inherited genetic problems.  does anything really work to treat autoimmune problems?  the side effects of autoimmune meds are worse than the diseases they are treating.",Take it as it is,2018-04-19 00:31:11,nan,nan,nan
10,Undisclosed results and unknown result sources,1,False,"undisclosed results and unknown result sources. you can have a long list of results and not know what they are referencing. perhaps you had 10 different tests (blood, lung aspiration, urinalysis and so on) and each test had tested for protein.  ...the lab results will have 10 different protein results but you won't know what assay each are from. also:  not every test you go in for will populate to your portal. why not?!?  it’s my test, i paid... you better let me have the ability to view. this goes for certain pathology tests, neurological exams, fertility tests (including ultrasounds)and many more!!!!  why do you (mayo clinic) hide results from patients?  why!!!? i’ve updated review down to one star. you’ve had enough time to fix these issues.  one star is generous. notice no developer response to this date because for some reason mayo doesn’t want you to have access to your entire result list and won’t attempt to categorize your test results. this is to control the patient, negligence, or do not care about patient needs. would like to know which of these are/is the reason.",338 479 218,2018-07-29 17:52:30,nan,nan,nan
11,Not as functional as it should be,1,False,"not as functional as it should be. firstly, and most importantly, the notifications don’t work. all i receive is a badge on the app when all the possible notifications are selected (banner, sound, etc). to make matters worse, when you open the app to figure out what the badge notification is for, there isn’t any badge or obvious sign anywhere to let me know where to look for the new or changed information. i have to go through each area to figure it out and today, i couldn’t find anything.   secondly, the “coach chat” and “experiments” functions never work. it always says “we’re sorry, something happened, but we’ll be back soon” then says to check my network connection. believe me, my network connection is fine and as many times as i have attempted to use the function, it wouldn’t have been down every single time considering all my other devices work just fine.   thirdly, you cannot update anything within the app. i even received a message (after searching for what i was notified for) to update my allergies. i went into the allergy section and there is literally no way to update them. i tried long hold, swiping right, swiping left, and looked for a button to edit, but nothing was working. i waited until my appointment to do it there.  i really wish the notification thing would be fixed asap because it causes me the most anxiety that i’m missing something. calling the mayo clinic every time i can’t figure it out is ridiculous.",amknbk,2018-06-07 17:49:22,"Amknbk, sorry the notifications aren’t working well for you.  We know how annoying it is when you expect something to work and it doesn’t.  The badge notifications in the version of the app you’re using are only alerting you to new content available in the Today feed of the app.  In a future build we’ll be enabling badges in the patient tab of the app to alert you to what has changed on your record - we’re not there yet though unfortunately.  So no need to call to figure out if something is changed based on that badge.  

The app doesn’t currently allow updating of medical record content.  We hope to add that in the future.  You can update your allergy information as part of the pre-appointment questionnaires and I suspect that is where that message you received generated from.

For coach chat and experiments - we can help you troubleshoot that - please send us an email with your username and brief description of this issue and we’ll try to help you get this fixed and hopefully improve our app for future versions.

590,The bar is set for American healthcare,5,False,"the bar is set for american healthcare. having been in other medical programs and longing to experience the mayo system, i finally had my chance to receive 2 full days of treatment. during the very first appointment i was introduced to this app - and the bar was set. i could ditch my literal 1/2"" thick stack of papers and forms that i had grown accustomed to traveling with while in any hospital.   this app is as amazing as the staff and system at the mayo clinic. it only makes sense that i should be able to see the same medical results that my doctors can see, i can read their write-ups after my  visits, and do my own research using their in-app library of papers, news and videos.   logistically, this app is better than apple maps as it keeps your list of appointments organized and as up to date as the registration desk you just left. all while remaining synced with your calendar.  i had a few appointments that needed rescheduling/flipping with others and as soon as the registration desk was done making the change, i could look up the new information on this app, get the map to the appointment location, and all the patient prep documents at my fingertips. talk about making the patient part of the care team!  i feel like this is the new standard for healthcare. mayo's approach of treating the patient experience as ""the only experience"" can be felt during your interactions with the staff and as you interact with this app. i only hope the rest of the american healthcare system is watching and learning how the healthcare system should work.",trial user 12345,2013-06-01 12:56:02,nan,nan,nan

614,OK but could be better,3,False,"ok but could be better. i've used both the app and the online portal extensively and while both were ahead of their time initially, in today's world when most provider's provide a portal to patient information, i find mayo's portal is becoming antiquated.  overall, you can do more using the online portal, but the app is more user friendly when it works. it can be glitchy and if this occurs, deleting and reinstalling the app may improve glitch issues.  things i'd like to see improved with both:  a patient note section that patients can use to create their own notes. having someplace central where patients can keep information  relevant to their appointments or care, would allow us to have one central repository for all our information. currently i use evernote for my notes, so jumping back and forth between the 2 is cumbersome.  the messaging utility is lacking. for people who have periodic physicals at mayo's it's frustrating. any contacts from one physical are removed and replaced when another physical occurs, yet many of those earlier providers are still relevant and should be left accessible to patients.  executive physicals manipulates the contact information in a sort of heavy handed manner. rather than providing patients with access to all their care givers, the executive team doesn't want patients to communicate directly with their main provider. they route all communications through them which adds days onto any communications...not a great scenario when timely information is important.    this one aspect alone impairs the whole executive physical so much that i think it negates the positive concierge aspects of this service. in the end, patients medical needs are primary and the executive physicals program needs to rethink how they restrict patients' access to their providers...especially in light of the increased costs involved in using this service versus the more traditional one for physicals.  patient access to their medical information is quick and generally good, but there are a few problems. the most notable being that things like final reports for longer stays and physicals should be available via the portal. these reports are usually mailed or sent by email and should be included with all the other reports.   finding medical information with the app or the portal is unnecessarily complex. i don't know how it can be fixed...but it needs to be. random reports that don't seem to fall into other categories sometimes show up under the continuity of care section. reports from older visits are oftentimes removed when newer visits occur...but these old reports are still important.   most patients coming to mayo's have greater medical needs or more complex issues than your average patient. mayo's isn't usually their primary care provider either, so they rely more heavily upon the reports which their primary care givers need. this function currently has bottlenecks ranging from:  - reports just never being available like full follow up summaries - reports being removed when new visits occur - some really old reports like medications lists are stuck in there and even though newer ones have been supplied and may be found somewhere else...the old ones just confuse both providers and patients. - there should be better ways for patients to export data in the reports. while exporting a complete report is possible...sometimes just a portion of it is needed. i use the print - to pdf method on ios to extract this information...but most people don't know how to do this and there should be simpler methods.  lab results are exemplary in that they include historic results and provide graphs when appropriate. this is a good example of reporting at it's best.   when i was there i found the app didn't always provide me with the most current appointment schedule, so i ended up relying on the paper schedules that other reviewers have mentioned too.  overall the app and portal are ok. they once set the gold standard for patient's access to medical information but today both seem like they need at a minimum to be brought up to current standards.   better yet would be to improve these aspects to keep pace with the world renowned medical reputation mayo's continues to garner.",vsatips,2017-03-29 18:45:44,nan,nan,nan
