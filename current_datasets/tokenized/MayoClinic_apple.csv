2554,OK but could be better,3,False,"ok but could be better. i've used both the app and the online portal extensively and while both were ahead of their time initially, in today's world when most provider's provide a portal to patient information, i find mayo's portal is becoming antiquated.  overall, you can do more using the online portal, but the app is more user friendly when it works. it can be glitchy and if this occurs, deleting and reinstalling the app may improve glitch issues.  things i'd like to see improved with both:  a patient note section that patients can use to create their own notes. having someplace central where patients can keep information  relevant to their appointments or care, would allow us to have one central repository for all our information. currently i use evernote for my notes, so jumping back and forth between the 2 is cumbersome.  the messaging utility is lacking. for people who have periodic physicals at mayo's it's frustrating. any contacts from one physical are removed and replaced when another physical occurs, yet many of those earlier providers are still relevant and should be left accessible to patients.  executive physicals manipulates the contact information in a sort of heavy handed manner. rather than providing patients with access to all their care givers, the executive team doesn't want patients to communicate directly with their main provider. they route all communications through them which adds days onto any communications...not a great scenario when timely information is important.    this one aspect alone impairs the whole executive physical so much that i think it negates the positive concierge aspects of this service. in the end, patients medical needs are primary and the executive physicals program needs to rethink how they restrict patients' access to their providers...especially in light of the increased costs involved in using this service versus the more traditional one for physicals.  patient access to their medical information is quick and generally good, but there are a few problems. the most notable being that things like final reports for longer stays and physicals should be available via the portal. these reports are usually mailed or sent by email and should be included with all the other reports.   finding medical information with the app or the portal is unnecessarily complex. i don't know how it can be fixed...but it needs to be. random reports that don't seem to fall into other categories sometimes show up under the continuity of care section. reports from older visits are oftentimes removed when newer visits occur...but these old reports are still important.   most patients coming to mayo's have greater medical needs or more complex issues than your average patient. mayo's isn't usually their primary care provider either, so they rely more heavily upon the reports which their primary care givers need. this function currently has bottlenecks ranging from:  - reports just never being available like full follow up summaries - reports being removed when new visits occur - some really old reports like medications lists are stuck in there and even though newer ones have been supplied and may be found somewhere else...the old ones just confuse both providers and patients. - there should be better ways for patients to export data in the reports. while exporting a complete report is possible...sometimes just a portion of it is needed. i use the print - to pdf method on ios to extract this information...but most people don't know how to do this and there should be simpler methods.  lab results are exemplary in that they include historic results and provide graphs when appropriate. this is a good example of reporting at it's best.   when i was there i found the app didn't always provide me with the most current appointment schedule, so i ended up relying on the paper schedules that other reviewers have mentioned too.  overall the app and portal are ok. they once set the gold standard for patient's access to medical information but today both seem like they need at a minimum to be brought up to current standards.   better yet would be to improve these aspects to keep pace with the world renowned medical reputation mayo's continues to garner.",vsatips,2017-03-29 18:45:44,nan,nan,nan,1,ok but could be better.,615
